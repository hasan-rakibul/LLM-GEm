      "Sharbat Gula, the Afghan woman known for her striking green eyes in a National Geographic cover photo, has been arrested in Pakistan for falsifying documents and staying illegally in the country. If convicted, she could face up to 14 years in jail or deportation. Last year, Gula was arrested on similar charges but was later released. Photographer Steve McCurry, who took the iconic photo, has expressed his objection to her arrest and is committed to helping her legally and financially. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) stated that they can only assist Gula if she registers as a refugee, but she falls under the category of \"undocumented migrants.\" The arrest highlights the mounting pressure on Afghan refugees in Pakistan to return home, with over 370,000 Afghans being repatriated since July 1. Human Rights Watch has raised concerns about the situation, stating that millions of Afghans have sought shelter in Pakistan due to conflict and poverty in their own country.\n",

      "More survivors of the Leviathan II tragedy, in which a whale-watching boat capsized and killed six people, have filed a lawsuit against the tour operator. The lawsuit describes the terrifying moments after the boat capsized, with the ship pitching and rolling in significant waves caused by a shallow reef. The captain had stopped the boat to view sea lions when a swell rose into a larger wave, causing the vessel to heel over. One of the plaintiffs, Robert Goodfellow, was submerged beneath the sea for a considerable period of time before swimming to the surface. Another plaintiff, Marya Levin, pushed a cushion towards two other passengers who were in danger of being struck by rotating propellers. Goodfellow and Levin eventually reached a lifeboat and are now seeking damages from the tour operator for physical, mental, and emotional trauma. Other survivors have also filed lawsuits, including one detailing their attempts to escape the sinking ship and a class-action suit citing post-traumatic stress disorder. The tour operator has referred to the sinking as an \"act of god.\"\n",

      "The Forced From Home exhibit organized by MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) aims to teach empathy for refugees by allowing participants to experience the journey of a displaced person. The exhibit has been attended by over 17,000 people, including 3,400 students. MSF hopes to communicate the reality of the refugee crisis and generate empathy in a time when anti-refugee sentiment is on the rise. The exhibit creates an empathetic response by assigning each participant a specific displaced person's identity and sharing personal stories from aid-workers who have served in MSF camps. The exhibit challenges the notion that empathy is a globalized response, as humans are wired to empathize with those in their immediate surroundings. However, empathy can be strengthened with practice and training programs have shown promise in changing people's responses to others' suffering. While empathy alone is not a solution to the refugee crisis, it is a necessary component in finding a genuine solution.\n",

The kennel was warned about ventilation problems, among other issues, by a certified master trainer and kennel care expert. The SPCA also received a copy of the complaints but is unable to pursue them due to lack of power. The dogs died of heat exhaustion after a malfunction in the building's heating system caused the room they were in to become excessively hot. The kennel manager expressed remorse and stated that the upper-floor room where the deaths occurred has been closed off. The kennel will remain open. The kennel had previously received positive reviews from customers, but the trainer who raised concerns said that customers don't see the full picture. The trainer quit after management refused his suggestions and took his list of concerns to the SPCA.

Inmates have no say in who they share a cell with, even if the cellmate has a violent history or severe mental illness. If they refuse a cellmate, they are placed in restraints for hours or days. Restraints are also used as punishment for inmates who break rules or get into fights.

In 2014 and 2015, there were 228 in-cell fights and assaults at Lewisburg, resulting in injuries and even deaths. The use of restraints at Lewisburg has been criticized by inmates, lawyers, and auditors, but the Bureau of Prisons denies any mistreatment.

The study emphasizes the need to focus on reducing demand for ivory in order to save elephants from extinction. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of accurately determining the amount of ivory within each country's borders to set sustainable quotas.

Russian warplanes have been backing the regime with airstrikes since September, causing destruction in Aleppo. The UN warned that the city is on the brink of starvation and lacks essential supplies. Turkey has been carrying out airstrikes in northern Syria to support the Free Syrian Army and plans to move on to Manbij after liberating al-Bab from ISIS. This move has stirred sectarian tensions and complicated efforts to free Syrian cities from ISIS control. Turkey considers some Kurdish militia groups as terrorists, while the US supports and arms them. The conflict between the US and Russia over which groups to target in Syria further complicates the situation.\n",

      "The war in Aleppo, Syria has had a devastating impact on the city's older residents. Many of them are facing difficult circumstances, including food and medicine shortages, as well as neglect from their families. The siege imposed by pro-government forces has made it nearly impossible to find medicine to treat chronic diseases commonly experienced by older people. Overstretched medical facilities are unable to provide proper care, leading to more deaths. Some families have even abandoned their older family members due to the extreme conditions. The situation has left many older residents feeling weak, frightened, and helpless. Despite the dangers, some refuse to leave their homes, while others are trapped and unable to leave due to the siege. The older residents of Aleppo are struggling to balance their own needs with the demands of their families, often sacrificing their own well-being. The war has taken away their dignity and left them feeling isolated and afraid.\n",

      "A new study from the University of Washington, funded by NASA and other agencies, reveals that all 19 polar bear populations across the Arctic are facing a shorter sea ice season. The study, which is the first to quantify the sea ice changes in each polar bear subpopulation, shows a trend towards earlier sea ice melt in the spring and later ice growth in the fall. These changes negatively impact the feeding and breeding capabilities of the bears, as they rely on the sea ice for essential activities such as hunting and traveling. The study also found that the critical timing of the sea ice break-up and freeze-up is changing in all areas, which is harmful for polar bears. The researchers recommend that the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance be incorporated as measures of climate change in future reports.\n",

Crapser has spent 37 of his 41 years in the United States and has a family there. However, he is being held in an immigration detention center and will be deported as soon as the necessary arrangements are made. Crapser's life in the United States has been difficult, including being abandoned by his adoptive parents and experiencing abuse in subsequent foster homes. He has also had a criminal record, which makes him eligible for deportation. The deportation is a result of his adoptive parents and the adoption agency failing to register him for U.S. citizenship. Many intercountry adoptees face this issue, and Congress is currently considering a bill that would grant citizenship to all children adopted by U.S. citizens. Crapser hopes that the bill will pass, but it will be too late for him.

Two-thirds of this waste is attributed to consumers. The paper highlights the negative environmental impact of food waste, as 95% of it ends up in landfills. Ohio State University professor Brian Roe suggests that increasing awareness of the issue can lead to purposeful action to reduce food waste. A national survey conducted last year found that 53% of Americans are aware of the problem, a 10% increase from a previous study. The survey also revealed that many people believe throwing away food after the package date reduces the risk of food-related illnesses and that some food waste is necessary for freshness. Additionally, 77% of respondents feel guilty about wasting food, while 58% understand the environmental consequences.

In reality, refugees face a lengthy screening process by the United Nations before coming to the US.

CMV can cause permanent disabilities such as hearing loss, microcephaly, intellectual deficits, and vision abnormalities in up to 20% of infected infants. There is no vaccine or standard treatment for CMV, but there are hints that antiviral drugs may benefit some newborns. CMV is transmitted through contact with saliva and urine, often from diaper-wearing children to adults. Pregnant women often get it from toddlers, especially those in day care. However, few women are warned about this infection, and less than half of obstetrician-gynecologists provide information on how to avoid CMV. Some experts argue that education campaigns and infant screening for the infection should be carried out to prevent the devastating effects of CMV. Routine screening of newborns for CMV is being pushed to identify those who are infected early and provide them with necessary tests and treatment. A recent study found that infants with CMV symptoms at birth who took an antiviral drug for six months had better hearing and cognitive skills at 2 years. However, it is not yet known if antiviral medication is safe and effective for babies with only hearing loss as a symptom.

      "The Cavendish banana, which is the most widely sold banana in the Western world, is facing the threat of extinction due to its vulnerability to diseases. The previous popular variety, Gros Michel, was wiped out by a fungal disease called Fusarium wilt. The Cavendish replaced it but is now susceptible to a disease called Black Sigatoka. Additionally, a new strain of Fusarium wilt called Tropical Race 4 (TR4) is spreading and could devastate the banana industry. To combat these diseases, scientists are studying the genetics of wild banana varieties and banana pathogens to find resistant genes. However, there has been little effort and funding for this research. By increasing genetic diversity in cultivated bananas, the industry can reduce its vulnerability to diseases. Scientists have already identified the genome sequences of bananas and the fungi causing the diseases, which provides a basis for identifying disease-resistant genes. With the use of genetic engineering and plant breeding, these genes can be transferred into desired cultivars. It is crucial to increase the pool of genetic diversity in cultivated bananas to avoid repeating the history of the Gros Michel and Cavendish varieties.\n",

      "Chicago has shut down hundreds of public drinking fountains due to excessive levels of lead in the water. The ongoing crisis in Flint, Michigan has prompted other communities to test for lead, including the Chicago Park District. Testing revealed that nearly a quarter of outdoor fountains and 14 indoor fountains and sinks exceeded the federal standard for lead levels. Some fountains had lead levels 80 times higher than the permissible level. All fountains and sinks with high lead levels have been disabled and will undergo further testing and repairs. The lack of adequate testing for lead in public settings is a national problem, according to public health officials. Lead can have serious health effects, especially in young children, and there is no safe level of lead in the body. Lead pipes and fixtures are still common in communities across the country. While taking a sip from a single fountain may not seriously affect health, it can contribute to cumulative lead exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations like the homeless and children.\n",

The victim, Amanda, revealed that her parents forced her to have sex with them and even made her pose for explicit photographs and videos to sell online. Her mother, Justine, expressed remorse for her actions and admitted to making poor choices. Both parents were charged with sexual assault and exploitation and received 20-year prison sentences. Amanda also claimed that her mother coached her sexually and was a willing participant in the abuse. Despite the trauma, Amanda's parents would continue with normal family life after the abuse. Amanda has struggled to come to terms with the fact that her parents are now out of prison. Her father, Jim, has yet to apologize to her and has been described as manipulative.

The battle against the Islamic State has resulted in soldiers and civilians being injured or killed by chlorine gas, mortar fire, bombs, and artillery shells. The presence of civilians in the city has made the fight more difficult for Iraqi forces and airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition. The Islamic State has been using civilians as human shields, preventing them from leaving the city.

The report highlights the impact of warming temperatures on farmland, which will reduce the global area suitable for coffee by about 50%. It also emphasizes the increased risk of diseases and pests, such as coffee rust and the coffee berry borer. Major coffee companies have been aware of these threats for years and have been implementing support programs for coffee growers. However, the report suggests that no single company is large enough to tackle the challenge of climate change on its own. The World Coffee Research group is developing adaptive strategies to address the issue, including preserving genetic diversity, creating a variety catalog, and evaluating new coffee varieties. Despite these efforts, there are still major gaps in knowledge on how to best help coffee producers adapt to climate change. The report raises concerns about the livelihoods of the 125 million people worldwide who depend on coffee, particularly those in developing countries.

The microbe is resistant to common antibiotics, making treatment difficult. The outbreak is unusual because the bacteria is typically found in hospitals, but many of the infected individuals have not had recent contact with healthcare facilities. Investigators are testing various products for contamination as a possible source. The outbreak is challenging to understand as little is known about Elizabethkingia. The bacteria is commonly found in soil and mosquitoes, and it thrives in moist biofilms. Previous outbreaks have been linked to contaminated taps in hospitals. The current outbreak is the first reported of this particular species of Elizabethkingia.

Lesin, who helped create the Kremlin's Russia Today television network, was found dead in a D.C. hotel room in November 2015. Initially ruled as \"undetermined,\" the manner of death has now been amended to an accident with acute ethanol intoxication as a contributing cause. Lesin's death was caused by blunt-force injuries to his head, as well as injuries to his neck, torso, arms, and legs from falls. The investigation determined that Lesin entered his hotel room for the final time after days of excessive alcohol consumption and was found dead the next morning. The ruling of accidental death has been accepted by the interim D.C. police chief. Lesin was known for his role in the Kremlin-dominated media landscape and his volatile temper. He resigned as head of Gazprom-Media in 2014 and kept a low profile until his death.

      "A flamingo named Pinky was euthanized after a visitor at Busch Gardens in Tampa, Florida, allegedly attacked her. The visitor, Joseph Anthony Corrao, reached into Pinky's pen, grabbed her, and threw her to the ground. Pinky was known for her distinctive walking style called the \"Flamingo Flamenco.\" Witnesses reported that Corrao had also picked up another flamingo but put it down unharmed. Pinky had become a beloved member of the park and had made appearances for conservation and education efforts. Corrao was charged with animal cruelty and jailed on a $2,000 bond. The judge described the act as \"bordering on depraved.\"\n",

The mudslide buried towns, killed 19 people, and caused extensive damage to the environment. The cleanup efforts by the mining company responsible have been slow and ineffective, and doubts remain about the safety of the river water. The government's priority now is to reforest the river banks to prevent further contamination. Many businesses, including fishing and steelmaking, rely on the river, and fishermen who lost their livelihoods receive compensation. However, many fishermen have lost hope of ever fishing in the river again.\n",

      "The suicides of two French girls who were bullied at school have sparked a debate about how to better protect teenagers. The story of Emilie, who took her own life in January, and the dramatization of Marion Fraisse's story, who died three years ago, have shed light on the issue of bullying in France. The film adaptation of Marion's story, titled \"Marion, 13 ans pour toujours - Marion, Forever 13,\" portrays the gradual descent of a young girl into depression and suicide. The film has prompted a discussion on social media, with many sharing their own experiences of bullying. France has attempted to address the problem with an anti-bullying law and a hotline for reporting incidents, but activists argue that more needs to be done. The issue of bullying extends beyond the school gates, with cyber-bullying also being a concern. Parents, teachers, and students are encouraged to openly discuss the problem to find a solution. Emilie's story, published in her diary, highlights the emotional and physical abuse she endured at school. A report by Unicef states that bullying is a global issue with severe negative effects on children's mental health. The recent attention on these tragic cases may lead to a change in how bullying is addressed in France.\n",

      "A study suggests that garden ponds are contributing to the spread of deadly frog diseases in the UK. Ranaviruses, which can infect amphibians, reptiles, and fish, have devastated common frog populations. The research indicates that infected animals from aquatic retailers or the movement of species between ponds may be worsening the problem. The virus appears to be spreading faster than frogs can hop, and human-aided dispersal is likely involved. Ranaviruses are a group of viruses found worldwide, and they can kill common frogs by causing sores and blisters on their skin or internal bleeding. Genetic records suggest that ranavirus was introduced to the UK on two separate occasions. Garden ponds can act as stepping stones for infected animals to reach new sites, and the transfer of frogspawn or frogs between ponds may be aiding the spread of the virus. The study emphasizes the need to manage the risk of disease outbreaks while still supporting wildlife by adding ponds to urban gardens. Limiting the movement of potentially-infectious material is strongly advised.\n",

      "A new study suggesting that Earth could be doomed to warming of up to 13 degrees Fahrenheit is being dismissed as flawed by climate scientists. The study, published in Nature, offers a reconstruction of global sea-surface temperatures for the past two million years. However, several top scientists argue that the author's conclusions about catastrophic temperature rise are not supported by the data. They claim that the study's author made a fundamental mistake in her analysis. Other scientists also criticize the study for extrapolating from past ice ages to the present climate. NASA's chief climate scientist states that if greenhouse gas levels stay the same, temperatures may rise an additional 0.5 to 1 degree Celsius, not 7 degrees. The study's author defends her work, stating that it shows a close relationship between temperature and greenhouse gases. However, critics argue that her method is not the way to determine the Earth's sensitivity to CO2. The question of how sensitive Earth's climate will be to CO2 emissions remains open.

With just a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, major impacts are already being felt in natural systems. More than 80% of ecological processes that support healthy marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems show signs of responses to climate change. These impacts have consequences for humans, including increased pests and disease outbreaks, unpredictable changes in fisheries, and decreasing agriculture yields. Understanding the adaptive capacity in nature can help address these issues and apply the same principles to crops, livestock, and aquacultural species.

This poses a risk to the world's ability to grow enough food, as these species provide almost half of the calories consumed by humans. The grass family is not only important for diets but also for global biodiversity and ecosystems. The study compared the rates of climate change niche change in grass species with projected climate change and found a significant difference. This suggests that many grass species may disappear from certain locations. While the study did not focus on food security, it highlights the potential problems for farmers growing food crops. However, there is ongoing research to develop \"climate-proof\" food crops using wild relatives of domesticated species. Unfortunately, these wild relatives are also at risk from climate change.\n",

      "Hate crimes against Muslims in the United States reached their highest level since 2001, with a 67% increase in anti-Islamic incidents in 2015 compared to the previous year. Experts and advocates attribute this rise to anger over terrorist attacks and anti-Islam rhetoric during the presidential campaign. The Council on American-Islamic Relations blames the mainstreaming of Islamophobia by public figures like Donald Trump for the increase in hate crimes. Overall hate crimes increased by 6.7% in 2015, with anti-black, anti-Jewish, and anti-sexual orientation incidents also rising. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported 201 incidents of election-related harassment and intimidation, and there were reports of hateful acts before and after Trump's election. The data is limited as many law enforcement agencies do not report hate crimes voluntarily. Analysts believe that the spike in hate crimes against Muslims is due to anger after terrorist attacks, prejudice against Muslims, and the labeling of Muslims as enemies. The professor who wrote about the surge in crimes against Muslims expects that the levels of hate crimes in 2016 are either at or above those of 2015.\n",

In Australia's Vasse River, goldfish have thrived and grown to large sizes, with some reaching 16 inches and four pounds. Goldfish invasions have also been reported in other places like Nevada, Colorado, and Alberta. The growth rate of goldfish in the Vasse River is the fastest known in the world. The problem with goldfish invasions stems from a disconnect between how people view goldfish as cute pets and their behavior in the wild. Goldfish are capable of rapid reproduction, uprooting vegetation, disturbing sediment, and transmitting diseases and parasites. Eradicating goldfish is difficult once they are established. Recent research has shown that goldfish are long-distance swimmers and migrate to spawn. Understanding goldfish behavior can help inform management strategies.

It is unknown if Zika will strike Africa and Asia with the same ferocity as the Americas, but experts believe the two strains of Zika will be cross-protective. The uncertainty surrounding Zika's future affects the prospects for a vaccine. If Zika activity subsides, it will be difficult to conduct clinical trials to prove the vaccine's effectiveness. However, the fear of the virus's impact on developing fetuses may continue to drive demand for a vaccine.\n",

Those who refuse to comply are shot, while others are taken but manage to escape. The militants are also executing former policemen and army officers out of paranoia. This tactic of holding civilians hostage complicates the U.S.-led airstrikes and puts civilians at risk of being caught in crossfire. The militants have also set fire to oil wells and a sulfur plant, causing noxious fumes. As Iraqi forces advance towards Mosul, the militants are expected to put up a tough fight.\n",

The jury was deadlocked, with some leaning towards a conviction of voluntary manslaughter. The officer, Ray Tensing, shot Sam DuBose in the head after pulling him over for a missing license plate. Tensing testified that he feared for his life, but prosecutors argued that the evidence contradicted his story. The judge set a new hearing date to determine if the case will be retried. The DuBose family wants another trial and is disappointed with the jury's inability to reach a conclusion. The shooting has raised attention to how police deal with blacks. Legal experts say juries tend to give police officers the benefit of the doubt, but will convict if the actions were clearly unwarranted.

      "Sleep paralysis is a common sleep problem that affects around 8% of the population. It occurs when a person is awake and conscious but unable to move, except for their eyes. Sleep paralysis often involves nightmares or hallucinations and can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The causes of sleep paralysis are not fully understood, but stress and disruptions to sleep, such as alcohol or caffeine, can increase the risk. It can also be a symptom of other sleep disorders and mental health conditions. Kendall Jenner discussed her struggles with sleep paralysis, which may be linked to her anxiety and jet lag. Sleep paralysis is more common in people with mental health problems and young adults. For most people, it is not a chronic condition, but some individuals experience recurrent episodes. Practicing good sleep behaviors, such as avoiding alcohol and caffeine and sleeping on your side, can help prevent sleep paralysis. If it becomes a problem, a specialist may be able to prescribe medications to suppress REM sleep and alleviate symptoms.\n",

      "The Bramble Cay melomys, a reddish-brown rodent, recently made international news when it was declared extinct. While climate change played a role in its demise, human inaction was the ultimate cause. Rising sea levels due to climate change destroyed the melomys' habitat and food sources. However, it was revealed that Australian researchers had planned to start a captive breeding program for the melomys, but they were unable to find any individuals on Bramble Cay. This missed opportunity highlights the tragedy that had been unfolding for years. In a new paper, biologist John Woinarski and colleagues argue that the extinction of the melomys, along with two other Australian species, could have been prevented. The Christmas Island pipistrelle and Christmas Island forest skink also suffered from human neglect and inaction, allowing introduced predators to decimate their populations. Australia's biodiversity conservation law lacks explicit commitment to preventing human-caused extinctions, leaving species vulnerable. These extinctions are often overlooked due to the small size and remote locations of the species. Australia has the highest rate of mammal extinctions in the world, with 30 species lost since European colonization. Woinarski's assessment is driven by personal grief and a desire to learn from past mistakes. Australia still has over a thousand threatened and endangered species, and action is needed to prevent further extinctions. While climate change did contribute to the melomys' extinction, it is important to recognize the other environmental factors and the human choice to not save the species.\n",

      "A recent study suggests that men conceived through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a type of in vitro fertilization, may have lower sperm concentration and more fertility struggles compared to men conceived naturally. The study focused on 54 men conceived through ICSI and found that they had lower average sperm concentration, total sperm count, and total motile sperm count. The researchers suggest that couples should be informed about this potential outcome before undergoing ICSI. However, the study also found that a low sperm concentration in fathers did not necessarily match the values found in their sons. Therefore, some men conceived through ICSI may still be able to father children naturally. It is recommended for them to start trying to conceive at a younger age, as fertility declines with age.\n",

      "Mexico is bracing for the consequences of a Trump presidency, as his campaign promises of building a wall, renegotiating trade deals, and deporting Mexican immigrants threaten the country's economy and relationship with the US. The peso has already suffered a significant drop, and experts predict a turbulent financial future for Mexico. The election has also caused an existential crisis for Mexico, as it reflects the negative image the country has in the US. Canada is also concerned about the impact of Trump's presidency, particularly on trade. While some Canadians reacted with anxiety, others saw it as an opportunity for pride. The election has forced Mexico to rethink its relationship with the US, and President PeÃ±a Nieto has expressed his willingness to work with Trump. However, paying for a wall is out of Mexico's vision, and the country hopes to continue collaborating with the US for mutual development. The election will likely have the most profound impact on the economy, as the US and Mexico are deeply integrated in terms of trade and employment. Mexico is America's third-largest trading partner, and millions of American jobs are tied to trade with Mexico. Trump's argument that Mexico benefits more from NAFTA than the US resonated with some voters, but experts believe that Mexico has little leverage to apply pressure in the relationship. An economic crisis in Mexico could lead to a migration crisis, as Mexicans may seek work in the US. However, some believe that the threat from the outside will bring Mexicans together and encourage them to work harder. There is optimism that Trump's hostile talk will diminish once he takes office, and that economic factors will temper his policies towards Mexico.

The study involved analyzing surveys from over 2,200 well-educated moms across the country, and mothers of only middle-school-age children reported the highest levels of stress, loneliness, and emptiness. Middle school is a challenging time for children, with raging hormones, changing bodies and brains, exposure to peer pressure and risky behaviors, and a desire for independence while still feeling dependent on parents. Parents often struggle to navigate these changes and may not realize that their children still want a relationship with them. It is important for parents to listen, be supportive, and not give up during this time. Developing a strong relationship during middle school can carry into the teen years and young adulthood.

The report states that the water crisis in Flint, Michigan is not an isolated incident, and that violations of national rules protecting against lead contamination are widespread. The NRDC's analysis of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows that 5,363 water systems, serving more than 18 million people, breached the federal Lead and Copper Rule in 2015. These violations include inadequate testing for lead and insufficient treatment to prevent lead from leaching into the water supply. The violations occurred in almost every state, with 1,110 community water utilities providing water that exceeded the EPA's actionable limit for lead. Despite the widespread failure of water suppliers, very few were punished by the EPA last year. Of the over 8,000 violations, enforcement action was only taken against 11% of cases, and penalties were sought for just 3% of violations. The EPA has acknowledged the challenges in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule and has intensified work with state drinking water programs. However, a revised rule will not be implemented until 2017 at the earliest. The NRDC emphasizes that unsafe drinking water is a national problem that requires a national solution. The failure of the system to detect violations is highlighted by the fact that Flint was not considered in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule last year, despite the well-known water crisis. The CDC has reported that lead levels in the blood of Flint children significantly increased after the city switched its water supply. The NRDC also revealed that water utilities often manipulate test results to downplay lead levels. The Guardian has reported that at least 33 US cities have used methods to mask the true level of lead in water tests. The report raises concerns about the extent of the issue and calls for a coordinated effort at all levels to prevent future crises.\n",

Former President Vladimir Voronin, who is chairman of the communist party, stated that presidential candidates should be married and campaign with their spouses. He refused to even shake Sandu's hand, calling her a \"betrayal of family values\" and a \"national disgrace.\" Bishop Marchel, a leader in the Moldovan Orthodox Church, also attacked Sandu, claiming that her attitude towards Christian morality diverges from normal principles. Sandu defended herself, stating that being a single woman is not a shame. Voronin also criticized Sandu's opponent, Igor Dodon, but implied that Dodon is a preferable choice. Sandu has campaigned on a pro-European Union platform, while Dodon aligns his views with those of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

The rise in violence was driven by an increase in the murders of black men and an increase in gun murders. The number of firearm murders increased by roughly 1,500, while knife murders dropped slightly. The percentage of murders committed with guns increased to 71.5%. Despite the increase in murders, overall crime rates did not increase substantially. The attorney general mentioned the overall increase in violent crime but did not mention the increase in murders. A third of the murder increase was driven by ten larger cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Black men and women face less violence today than in the early 1990s.

Modi argued that the ban was necessary to fight corruption and reduce the use of unaccounted-for cash in the country. However, opposition leaders and many citizens have criticized the move, as people have faced long lines at banks and ATMs, and many machines have run out of cash. Despite the hardships, some individuals expressed support for the ban, believing that it will ultimately benefit the nation. The transition to new currency notes has been complicated by the fact that many ATMs are not working and cannot dispense the new notes. The Finance Ministry reported that Indians have deposited about $45 billion in banned currency notes since the policy began, while banks and ATMs have given out $7.5 billion in new currency notes. The ban has had a significant impact on businesses, with sales falling and customers unable to pay with cash. While some individuals believe the ban is necessary, others argue that it is causing unnecessary suffering for the poor and that the real black money is hidden in Swiss bank accounts.\n",

While few people have confirmed their departure, it is a topic of discussion among many. The state's economy will suffer if there is a decline in population, as it will reduce spending and tax revenue. Louisiana experienced a 6% population decrease after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, taking over five years to recover. Although this year's exodus is unlikely to be as severe, the shortage of available housing and the closure of small businesses due to the flooding pose challenges. Additionally, the decline in oil industry jobs and the state's high unemployment rate further complicate the situation. The aid and insurance money that typically accompanies natural disasters may not be enough to prevent people from leaving, exacerbating an already struggling economy.\n",

The severity of microcephaly can vary, but it often results in mental impairment. Detecting the condition before birth is difficult, leading to debates about abortion. Raising a child with microcephaly requires extensive care and support, which can be costly. Early intervention programs can help, but they often end after three years. The CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics have published guidelines for evaluating and caring for infants with Zika-related microcephaly. The cost of care for each child is estimated to be $10 million over a lifetime. Families with resources, like the Grounds family, can provide the best care for their child, but many others struggle. Nicholas, a child with microcephaly, has made progress with intensive intervention, but ongoing support is necessary. Parents of children with microcephaly need support throughout their lives.

The Paris climate agreement's proposed emissions cuts are not enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. To keep global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius, emissions need to be slashed by an additional 25 percent by 2030. Despite concerns about President-elect Donald Trump's stance on climate change, world leaders and activists remain committed to battling climate change.\n",

The report issued a critical citation because the barrier failed and caused harm to an animal. However, before the incident, the zoo had not been cited for shortcomings with the barrier during previous inspections. The zoo has since updated the barrier and is now in compliance with federal standards. The family of the child who entered the enclosure has stated that they do not want to pursue legal action against the zoo. The USDA has issued 10 citations at the zoo in the last three years, but none were related to the gorilla exhibit. The Cincinnati Zoo officials have reaffirmed their commitment to the well-being of the animals and the safety of visitors.

      "Prominent Republican women are concerned that defending Donald Trump against accusations of sexual assault is damaging the party's relationship with female voters. Trump's comments about women have been a source of concern throughout his campaign, but the release of a 2005 video and subsequent allegations by 11 women have escalated the issue. Many male Republicans have come to Trump's defense, dismissing the accusers and potentially alienating female voters. This division within the party comes as polls show that women are supporting Hillary Clinton by a significant margin. Female Republican strategists and politicians, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Carly Fiorina, have distanced themselves from Trump. The recent interview between Newt Gingrich and Megyn Kelly further highlighted the party's struggle with women voters. Republican women are increasingly feeling that the party does not represent them and are critical of the party's handling of Trump's behavior. The GOP's treatment of women is playing into the \"war on women\" narrative that Democrats have pushed in the past. Trump's personal attacks on women, both in the media and on social media, have also contributed to the party's struggle with female voters. Overall, many Republican women believe that the party is not doing enough to address the concerns of female voters and that this will have negative consequences for the party in the general election.\n",

      "Republicans in Congress are concerned about potential losses in the upcoming election. They are accepting the possibility of a Hillary Clinton victory and a Democratic majority in the Senate. This has led to discussions about how Republicans should proceed after the election. They must decide whether to cooperate with Democrats and try to get things done, or to adopt a noncooperative strategy in hopes of regaining control in the 2018 midterm elections. There are also questions about the future of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the Supreme Court nominee. Republicans fear that Clinton will be influenced by progressive forces and that compromises will be difficult to achieve. They also worry about the dissatisfaction among their voters and the potential backlash if they work with Democrats. However, some Republicans argue that waiting until 2018 may be a better strategy. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer believes there is a moral imperative to get government working again and hopes to work with Republicans. Hillary Clinton is seen as someone capable of building relationships with Republican leaders. Overall, if Democrats win the White House and Senate, considerable effort will be needed to bring a new spirit to a gridlocked Congress.\n",

The majority of these casualties were caused by airstrikes from a coalition led by Saudi Arabia. At least 329 civilians have been killed and 426 injured since the beginning of August. Saudi Arabia and its allies are trying to prevent an international investigation into possible war crimes. The United States and Britain, major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia, are finding it harder to ignore the bloodshed. The most recent example of the carnage was an airstrike on a market and residential area in Hodeidah, which killed at least 26 civilians. The United Nations has documented numerous attacks on civilian facilities by both coalition and rebel forces. Doctors Without Borders has pulled staff members out of six hospitals in Yemen after coalition planes bombed a facility. The United Nations has also expressed concern over the blockade of the city of Taiz, which has left residents critically short of food and water. The majority of civilian casualties have been caused by the Saudi-led coalition, according to a report to the Human Rights Council. Saudi Arabia and President Hadi's government have condemned the report as biased and have proposed a Yemeni commission to investigate human rights violations. Rights groups argue that a national body lacks expertise and that its reporting falls short of international standards. The European Union has drafted a competing resolution calling for a United Nations mission to Yemen. The Council will decide how to proceed after a week of diplomatic negotiations.

      "Scientists have found that the method used by the U.S. poultry industry to stun chickens before slaughter does not consistently render them unconscious. This means that a significant number of chickens likely experience intense suffering when they are killed. The lack of regulations governing the humane slaughter of chickens in the U.S. has allowed poultry companies to prioritize meat quality over ensuring that chickens are reliably stunned. Animal protection groups are pressuring companies to phase out the use of electric water-baths and adopt alternative methods, such as controlled atmosphere killing. Gas stunning systems are considered more humane and produce better meat quality. The current process of slaughtering chickens also causes them stress and pain, with many experiencing broken bones and wing damage. The U.S. Agriculture Department estimates that hundreds of thousands of birds are unintentionally boiled alive each year. Animal welfare groups are campaigning to improve conditions for broiler chickens and some companies, like Perdue Farms, have pledged to install gas stunning systems in their facilities.\n",

Health officials and scientists are investigating other factors that may be contributing to the higher toll in this region, such as the presence of other mosquito-borne viruses or environmental and genetic factors. The number of cases of birth defects linked to Zika outside of Brazil has been relatively low, leading researchers to caution that it will take years to fully understand the dangers the virus poses to babies' brains. The outbreak in Puerto Rico is being closely monitored, but the mainland United States has so far averted a major outbreak.

The research explains that seabirds rely on their sense of smell to hunt for food, and the scent emitted by plastic in the ocean tricks them into confusing it with food. The study also found that birds that track the scent of a sulfurous compound emitted by algae, which coats floating plastic, are six times more likely to consume plastic. The research sheds light on species that are often overlooked, such as petrels and shearwaters, which are impacted by plastic ingestion. The study highlights the need to address the growing plastic pollution in oceans, which affects not only seabirds but also sea turtles, fish, and other marine animals.

      "The Supreme Court has halted the execution of an Alabama death row inmate, Thomas D. Arthur, for the seventh time. The execution was scheduled for Thursday evening but was stayed as officials waited for the Supreme Court to consider his appeals. Justice Clarence Thomas issued an order halting the execution until further notice. The court later granted Arthur's stay request, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voting in favor as a courtesy to his colleagues. The stay will remain in place until the justices decide whether to consider the case. Arthur was sentenced to death for the 1982 killing of Troy Wicker, the husband of a woman with whom Arthur had an affair. His attorneys argued against Alabama's lethal injection protocol and suggested execution by firing squad instead. The state's Department of Corrections is only allowed to carry out executions by injection and electrocution. Alabama's death penalty system has faced increased scrutiny following a Supreme Court ruling that struck down Florida's death penalty system.\n",

The squirrels were found to have two different species of leprosy bacterium, one of which is almost identical to a strain recovered from a medieval human skeleton. There is currently no evidence of squirrel-to-human transmission, but researchers are concerned about the health of the endangered red squirrels. The reason why squirrels, humans, and armadillos are the only known species to harbor the bacterium is still unknown. The discovery of leprosy in squirrels may help researchers understand how the disease manifests in humans and how it spreads.\n",

The officer, Arn Salao, was shot multiple times by the suspect, James Dale Ritchie, but managed to return fire and fight off his assailant. Another officer arrived at the scene and also fired at Ritchie, killing him. Ballistics tests revealed that the gun Ritchie used was the same one used in five other homicides in Anchorage in 2016. Ritchie had prior arrests for drugs and burglary and had recently returned to Alaska from West Virginia. Two of the victims linked to Ritchie's gun were identified as Jason Netter Sr. and Brianna Foisy, who were found dead in July. Another two victims, Bryant De Husson and Kevin Schuyler Turner, were found dead in August. The motive behind the killings is unknown, and it is unclear if Ritchie knew any of the victims.

Globally, progress towards economic equality has slowed, with the gender pay gap persisting and women's labor force participation lower than men's. The report warns that the global economic gender gap is not expected to close until 2196.

Teens were at the greatest risk, with an 80% increase in depression when taking the combined pill. Other hormone-based methods, such as the hormonal IUS/coil, the patch, and the ring, were shown to increase depression at a higher rate than oral contraceptives. The study suggests that the practice of encouraging teens to use these alternatives to the pill is misguided. The medical community's response to the study has been dismissive, with experts downplaying the link and offering paternalistic advice. The burden of avoiding unwanted pregnancy falls on women, despite the potential negative effects on their health and wellbeing. Effective alternatives to hormonal contraceptives exist, but they are often overlooked. It is important to remember that women are twice as likely to experience depression as men, and blaming women's depression on their biological femaleness is acceptable, but blaming medication formulated from synthetic hormones is not. The study's authors plan to research the possible association between hormonal birth control and suicide attempts or completions. While not every woman experiences depression and anxiety from hormonal contraceptives, it is important to acknowledge that many do, and their lives could be improved by recognizing and addressing this issue.\n",

The repeal of Obamacare and the proposed tax cuts would disproportionately affect the poor, with millions potentially losing access to healthcare and the highest-income taxpayers benefiting the most.

      "Male models are being paid up to 75% less than women, according to a top modelling agent. Elizabeth Rose, who manages male models at Premier, believes it is unfair and not a form of female empowerment. She explains that women can be paid up to Â£40,000 for a top show, while male models only receive Â£10,000 on average. However, she notes that the situation is slowly changing as advertisers are increasingly using male models for grooming products. Elizabeth also highlights that the top 10 female models all make millions, whereas only the top three male models earn over a million. She tries to negotiate higher fees for male models but acknowledges that women face more discrimination due to their age.

      "The Trump campaign has been pursuing a strategy of publicly courting black voters while privately seeking to depress their turnout, according to a BusinessWeek article. The campaign has three major voter suppression operations targeting idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. These operations include placing negative ads on select African American radio stations and using Facebook \"dark posts\" to deliver targeted messages. The campaign believes that depressing Clinton's vote total among these groups will benefit Trump. However, there is evidence that negative campaigning does not significantly depress voter turnout. Trump's approach to African Americans has been seen as insincere, with many of his events aimed at them taking place in predominantly white areas. As a result, Trump's polling among African Americans is poor, with him trailing Clinton by a large margin. While Trump's advisors believe that he doesn't need black votes to win, future Republican candidates will, and the campaign's efforts to suppress black voter turnout may harm the party's relationship with this demographic for years to come.\n",

      "Overpumping of groundwater in Dhaka, Bangladesh is causing a water crisis that extends beyond the city center. The pumping has caused groundwater levels to drop significantly over the past 50 years, leading to water quality and supply issues in surrounding peri-urban and rural communities. The presence of naturally occurring arsenic in shallow groundwater further exacerbates the problem. The pumping is causing faster groundwater flow, which can transport contaminants like arsenic to deeper areas of the aquifer, even outside the city limits. This poses a threat to deep wells used for arsenic mitigation in these areas. The researchers used detailed subsurface measurements to model the geology of Dhaka and found that strong pumping and heterogeneity in the underground sediments affect the hydrology of the area. Heterogeneity refers to the way sand and clay are oriented underground and is critical to how contaminants move in groundwater. In a delta system like Bangladesh, the clay layers are chopped up, allowing water to move in unpredictable ways and creating uncertainty about well contamination. The researchers theorize that if pumping continues at current levels, some wells outside the city center could become contaminated sooner than expected. The low water levels caused by pumping could also compromise the operation of handpumps in these areas. Arsenic is tasteless, odorless, and colorless, making it difficult for communities to detect its presence in water without testing. The researchers' models showed that typical hydrogeological data used to assess well safety is not predictive in this type of heterogeneous system. This highlights the need for water quality monitoring and the development of artificial groundwater recharge methods to address the water crisis in the region.\n",

CITES guidelines state that confiscated animals should be sent back to the exporting country, a designated rescue center, or other appropriate places, with humane treatment ensured. However, this doesn't always happen due to cost, impracticality, or lack of designated rescue centers.

      "The vaquita, the most endangered marine mammal on Earth, is facing extinction due to gill net fishing and the illegal trade of totoaba. Urgent conservation measures were approved to protect the vaquita, including a permanent ban on gill net fishing and efforts to crack down on the totoaba trade. However, experts argue that these measures are not enough to save the species. The current plan neglects local livelihoods, fails to involve local fishermen in designing a sustainable management plan, and does not adequately address the totoaba trade. The ban on gill nets is seen as a step forward, but more interventions are needed to ensure the vaquita's recovery. This case highlights the challenges and complexities of endangered species conservation. Conservation efforts often come too late or lack the thoroughness needed to make a lasting impact. A long-term vision and proactive action are necessary to effectively conserve species and natural resources.\n",

      "Thousands of women in Iceland left work early to protest the gender wage gap. They gathered in Austurvollur square in Reykjavik, shouting \"Out\" to discrimination against women. The protest highlighted the 30% pay gap between men and women in Iceland. The demonstration aimed to bring attention to the issue and demand change. Despite Iceland's reputation as a gender-equal nation, progress on pay equity has been slow. The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap ranking shows that Iceland still has gaps in earned income and wages for similar work. The report also reveals that global progress towards economic parity between men and women has suffered setbacks in recent years. The gender pay gap persists due to various factors, including women entering less well-paid professions and the time it takes for employers' implicit gender biases to change. The protest in Iceland emphasizes the urgency of addressing the gender pay gap and the need for faster progress.\n",

Mark Short's cousin and aunt revealed that the couple had been going through a tough separation, and Megan had alleged on Facebook that her husband was abusive. Mark had taken the family to Disney World in an attempt to salvage their relationship, but Megan still planned to leave. The police found the family dead of gunshot wounds in their home, along with a \"murder-suicide note\" and a handgun. Mark's relatives described him as a laid-back man who would do anything for his family. The family had struggled with their youngest child's health issues, and Megan had written about her PTSD and anxiety in a blog post. Despite their struggles, their Facebook profiles showed a happy family. Mark's body was expected to be released for a funeral in Delaware County, while Megan's family handled arrangements for her and the children.\n",

      "The Pilcomayo River in Paraguay is experiencing an extensive die-off of caiman, fish, and other river creatures due to a combination of drought and mismanagement. Up to 98% of caimans and 80% of capybaras are suspected dead. The river has dried up for nearly 435 miles and the government has declared an environmental emergency. The mismanagement of water resources and infrastructure by both Paraguay and Argentina has exacerbated the crisis. The river's wandering behavior and the significant amount of sediment it transports downstream have contributed to the blockage and dispersal of the river outside its channel. The government is working to find a solution, but there is no water to release or divert. Zimbabwe plans to sell its wildlife, including elephants and possibly endangered African wild dogs, to replenish its coffers due to cash shortages and a drought. Critics argue that the mismanagement of the economy and lack of accountability make this plan unworkable. South Australia has been hit by a destructive storm just 24 hours after a super cell thunderstorm knocked out the state's entire power network. The storm caused heavy rain, flooding, and major damage, and left thousands without power.

      "Wind turbines are not only killing local birds, but also birds from hundreds of miles away, according to researchers from Purdue University and the U.S. Geological Survey. Using DNA and stable isotopes, the researchers found that golden eagles killed at a wind farm in California can come from far distances. This raises concerns about the impact of wind farms on bird populations. The Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) in California, one of the oldest and largest wind farms in the world, has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of birds. The researchers found that eagles are attracted to the area due to the abundance of prey and the windy conditions, but fail to see the turbine blades and get hit. The study also revealed that a large percentage of the birds killed are from neighboring states, highlighting the need for environmental assessments to consider the impact on the entire population. The findings have implications for the management of wind energy facilities and the conservation of bird species.\n",

Teachers at his school had expressed concerns about his well-being, but social workers found no cause for alarm. The boy's stepfather believed he was living in Mexico until the mother revealed that he had died. The boy's body was found in a closet, severely malnourished and covered in pressure sores. The mother has been charged with murder and child abuse. The family lived in a one-bedroom house, with the boy kept hidden in closets and sedated with sleep medications. The other children in the family were aware of the situation but concealed it from their stepfather. The stepfather was devastated upon learning the truth and called the police.

Trump and Pence have expressed intentions to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which covers birth control. In response, some women are considering getting an intrauterine device (IUD) as a long-lasting form of birth control that could outlast any changes made by the administration. IUDs are highly effective and safe, with some versions lasting up to 12 years. Women are advised to take action soon, as an IUD can cost up to $1,000 without insurance coverage.

      "The number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen has risen to 1,410 within three weeks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The outbreak was declared on October 6, and by October 10, there were 24 suspected cases. However, as of Thursday, there were 1,410 suspected cases in 10 out of Yemen's 23 governorates. The conflict between a Saudi Arabia-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi group has destroyed much of Yemen's infrastructure, making it difficult to control the disease outbreak. Cholera is just one of the risks in Yemen's war, which has left millions displaced and in need of medical help. Only 47 of the suspected cases have tested positive for cholera, and the outbreak has spread beyond the capital to nine other governorates. Children under 10 account for half of the cases, with six deaths from cholera and 36 associated deaths from acute watery diarrhea. Prompt treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics is crucial in severe cases.\n",
