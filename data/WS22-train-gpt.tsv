Survivor accounts suggest that two overcrowded boats broke up just off the Libyan coast on Wednesday. The 31 survivors were taken to the Italian island of Lampedusa. If true, these shipwrecks bring the toll of dead and missing in the Mediterranean to 4,220 this year, the highest on record. Most of the migrants appear to have come from sub-Saharan Africa. The European Union is conducting a search-and-rescue operation in the western Mediterranean, but the focus remains on deterrence rather than protection. The shifting migration patterns have been a boon to smugglers, as demand has increased across the trickier North African route.

The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline received a significant increase in calls, with the volume being two to three times higher than usual. The Crisis Text Line also experienced a surge in texts, with eight times the normal volume. The Trevor Project, which provides support to LGBTQ youth, saw a doubling of call volume, with more than 95% of callers discussing the election. The Trans Lifeline, which supports the transgender community, has been flooded with calls since the election, receiving more than 500 calls a day. The election results have caused panic and fear among callers, particularly regarding the potential loss of insurance and trans-affirming healthcare. These crisis hotlines are urging people to support each other, get back to routines, and limit exposure to media that exacerbates feelings of hopelessness. Acts of kindness and compassion are also encouraged to help alleviate anxiety.

Duckworth accepted the apology and urged Kirk to focus on the issues. Kirk had questioned Duckworth's ties to the American Revolution, to which she responded by highlighting her family's long history of military service. Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's campaign manager, mocked Kirk over the incident. Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who lost her legs and partial use of her right arm during a mission, was born in Thailand but has deep American roots. Kirk has previously faced criticism for misrepresenting his military career. Duckworth's opponents have also faced criticism for attacking her war record.

The incident led to the closure of local beaches for 24 hours. The shark emerged from under the man while he was waiting for a wave, causing minor lacerations to his leg. The type of shark involved is unknown. This attack follows a similar incident in the same area a few weeks ago. The New South Wales coast has seen 14 unprovoked shark attacks in 2015, with a hotspot from Evans Head to Byron Bay. Efforts to control shark populations have been challenging, with a recent shark eco-barrier trial being canceled due to rough sea conditions. The government plans to increase tagging and relocation of sharks using ""smart drumlines"" to catch them. Shark attacks are on the rise due to the popularity of water sports and the movement of bait fish closer to shore, although fatalities are still rare."

Despite surviving World War II and other hardships, they are struggling to make ends meet on a meager pension. The falling ruble and rising prices have made it difficult for pensioners to afford basic necessities. Many have resorted to selling apples and relying on secondhand clothing and homegrown food. Medical care is also a challenge, as the cost of treatment is often too high. The government's response has been inadequate, offering a one-time payment instead of increasing pensions. Despite these difficulties, pensioners in Oryol have found solace in a DIY school for the elderly, where they can learn new skills and find companionship. However, they still long for a better quality of life and feel frustrated by the lack of support from the government."

If convicted, she could face up to 14 years in jail or deportation. Last year, Gula was arrested on similar charges but was later released. Photographer Steve McCurry, who took the iconic photo, has expressed his objection to her arrest and is committed to helping her legally and financially. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) stated that they can only assist Gula if she registers as a refugee, but she falls under the category of ""undocumented migrants."" The arrest highlights the mounting pressure on Afghan refugees in Pakistan to return home, with over 370,000 Afghans being repatriated since July 1. Human Rights Watch has raised concerns about the situation, stating that millions of Afghans have sought shelter in Pakistan due to conflict and poverty in their own country."

The majority of infected individuals do not experience symptoms, making it difficult to test for. Pregnant women are particularly at risk, as the virus can cause birth defects. Zika primarily spreads through infected mosquitoes, but it can also be transmitted through sexual contact. There is currently no vaccine or treatment for Zika, but scientists are making progress in developing them. The virus is prevalent in many countries, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Zika was first discovered in monkeys in Uganda in 1947 and has since spread to various parts of the world. In the United States, there have been thousands of cases, with Puerto Rico being heavily affected. The CDC has issued travel warnings for Zika in many countries.

The concierge, Abdulrahman, revealed that the robbers initially wanted money, not jewels. There was speculation that a diamond ring Kardashian West showed off on social media prompted the heist, but Abdulrahman clarified that the robber was only interested in money. After giving him the ring, the thief pocketed it and continued to demand money. Some jewels and gold were lost because the thief left the bag open. The police are still investigating, but no arrests have been made. Kardashian West has reduced her social media presence and public outings since the incident.

Afghanistan is facing a looming humanitarian crisis as the number of displaced people continues to rise. Over a million people were already uprooted last year, and this year, at least another million Afghans are on the move within the country and across its borders. The violence and conflict in Afghanistan have forced many to flee, while others are escaping poverty and drought. The United Nations and other aid agencies are struggling to provide emergency assistance, and if they fail, it will become a full-blown crisis. The country has been plagued by massive displacement since the Soviet invasion in 1979, and the current violence is some of the worst since the Taliban was toppled. The clashes between Afghan and Taliban forces have pushed even more people from their homes. The government is unable to reach all affected areas, and the Taliban now controls more territory than at any time since 2001. The return of refugees to areas controlled by insurgents is a concern, as it could exacerbate insecurity and joblessness. The displaced are often rejected and forced into squalid camps, with limited access to clean water and food. The situation is dire, and the government is incapable of creating jobs or improving the economy in remote areas. Criminal and terrorist networks may exploit the jobless and displaced youths, further deepening the crisis.

The Democratic Party suffered a shocking defeat in the recent election, with Donald Trump winning key demographics that were expected to support Democrats. Many Obama voters flipped to Trump, and he outperformed Romney among union households, whites without a college degree, and low-income households. The success of Obama's coalition may have been due to his unique talent as a politician, rather than a stable majority. The Democratic Party is now facing a struggle for dominance between Sanders supporters and the establishment wing. With no legislative victories in sight and upcoming electoral losses, the party's future is uncertain. Economic insecurity may have contributed to the rise of racism and far-right political parties. To prevent the views that led to Trump's victory, Democrats need to focus on delivering economic gains to working people.

Venezuelan children are fainting and falling asleep in school due to hunger. Many students are absent because their families cannot afford to buy food. One teacher reported that a student skipped class every Thursday because it was their family's designated day to buy food at government-regulated prices. Another teacher witnessed a child faint during a cultural event because they had only eaten an arepa at 10 a.m. and it was already 3 p.m. The government spends very little on meals in public schools, and a lawmaker criticized the government for prioritizing weapons over food. A recent poll revealed that 48% of the time children do not attend school, it is due to food-related issues. Many children eat only twice a day or even just once, and for some, the school lunch is their only meal of the day. Some parents are considering changing their children from private to public schools, while others are contemplating taking their children out of school altogether. In addition to the food crisis, public schools are also facing infrastructure problems, with stolen computers and desks and a lack of funds for school supplies.

A study published in Plos One reveals that Americans waste a significant amount of food, with about 133 billion pounds of edible food going uneaten in 2010. Two-thirds of this waste is attributed to consumers. The paper highlights the negative environmental impact of food waste, as 95% of it ends up in landfills. Ohio State University professor Brian Roe suggests that increasing awareness of the issue can lead to purposeful action to reduce food waste. A national survey conducted last year found that 53% of Americans are aware of the problem, a 10% increase from a previous study. The survey also revealed that many people believe throwing away food after the package date reduces the risk of food-related illnesses and that some food waste is necessary for freshness. Additionally, 77% of respondents feel guilty about wasting food, while 58% understand the environmental consequences. However, 51% believe it is difficult to reduce home food waste, and 42% claim to lack the time to address the issue.

"Iran has blinded a man for throwing acid in the face of a four-year-old girl. This punishment, known as ""eye-for-an-eye,"" was carried out for the second time this year. The attacker had previously blinded another girl in 2009. The law of retribution, a part of Islam's sharia code, allows victims to personally inflict punishments on their attackers. However, some victims choose to spare their attackers in exchange for blood money. Human rights groups have criticized this legal code as inhumane and brutal."

Bob Murken, the city's director of legislative affairs, had a near-death experience after being attacked by flesh-eating bacteria. He was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, a rare disease that has a 25% fatality rate. Murken underwent multiple surgeries and spent three weeks in critical care before being able to return home. Despite the ordeal, he was able to ride his bike to work again in mid-August. The timing of his illness was unfortunate, as he was in the midst of working on Mayor Kenney's tax on sweetened beverages.

Armed police in North Dakota have arrested 141 Native American protesters and environmental activists who were occupying private land in the path of a controversial new oil pipeline. The police used non-lethal rounds, pepper spray, and sound cannons to push the protesters back to their main encampment on public land. Skirmishes lasted overnight and continued until early Friday morning. The protesters were demonstrating against the pipeline, which they believe threatens the region's water supply and crosses land never ceded by the tribe. The police claimed they used non-lethal bean bag rounds in response to stone throwing and a woman firing a pistol at officers. The protest has been ongoing for months and has drawn the attention of activists and celebrities.

Obese patients face difficulties ranging from inadequate equipment to biased attitudes from healthcare providers. Doctors may spend less time with obese patients, fail to refer them for diagnostic tests, and attribute symptoms to their weight without investigating other causes. The lack of appropriate medical care for obese patients extends to treatments, with drug doses often not calibrated for obese patients and surgeons refusing to perform joint replacements unless the patient loses weight. The situation is further complicated by the fear of medical professionals of being penalized for complications and poor outcomes. The article also discusses the challenges faced by doctors and therapists in providing medical care to transgender patients due to limited knowledge and bias. The Mexican government's investigation into the disappearance of 43 college students in 2014 remains unsolved, leading many to question its ability and willingness to find answers. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is now being relied upon to provide justice and answers for the families of the missing students. The article highlights the stories of three survivors of the attacks in Iguala, Mexico, who continue to seek justice and fight for their rights.

Four Americans were killed in a suicide bomb attack at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. The attack also wounded 16 US service members and one Polish soldier. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it had been planned for four months. The US Embassy in Kabul will be closed as a precautionary measure. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg expressed support for those affected by the attack and reiterated NATO's commitment to fighting terrorism. Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. Urgent investigations are being carried out to determine how the attacker gained access to the base. This attack follows a series of recent attacks in Afghanistan, including a suicide car bomb targeting the German Consulate and a joint Afghan-US battle against the Taliban that resulted in civilian and military casualties.

A new study from Umeå University in Sweden found that high rates of air pollution are linked to poorer psychiatric health in children and adolescents. The researchers examined register-based data on individuals under 18 from different regions in Sweden and found that air pollution levels do impact psychiatric diagnoses in young people. The risk of having at least one psychiatric diagnosis increased with a 10 microgram per cubic meter increase in nitrogen dioxide levels in the air. Nitrogen dioxide is a harmful air pollutant that results from road traffic and fossil fuel use. Long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide has been associated with reduced lung function, respiratory problems, and increased allergy rates.

The US military has admitted that civilians were likely killed in a joint Afghan-US operation in Kunduz, Afghanistan. The operation targeted Taliban leaders planning attacks in the city. Alongside the 30 civilians, two US service members were also killed. The US military expressed regret for the loss of innocent lives and promised to investigate the incident. Afghan forces, with US military advice, conducted the operation and encountered significant enemy fire. In addition to the civilian casualties, four members of Afghan special forces were killed, and 26 insurgents were killed. The Pentagon identified the dead US service members and expressed condolences. The incident occurred on the same day as a Taliban mortar attack that killed seven people attending a wedding party. In April, the Pentagon announced disciplinary action for a fatal US strike on a Kunduz hospital in 2015. The strike was deemed unintentional human error and equipment failure, rather than a war crime.

The suspect behind the mall attack in Minnesota has been identified as 22-year-old Dahir Aden, a Somali-American student. He stabbed nine people at a shopping mall before being shot and killed by an off-duty police officer. Aden's family first learned of his death from the police, and authorities have not formally identified him as a suspect. Aden's father described him as an honors student with no history of violence. The Somali community expressed fears of backlash and called for unity. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities are still investigating any potential links to foreign terrorist organizations. The off-duty police officer was praised for his heroic actions in ending the attack.

The number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen has risen to 1,410 within three weeks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The outbreak was declared on October 6, and by October 10, there were 24 suspected cases. However, as of Thursday, there were 1,410 suspected cases in 10 out of Yemen's 23 governorates. The conflict between a Saudi Arabia-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi group has destroyed much of Yemen's infrastructure, making it difficult to control the disease outbreak. Cholera is just one of the risks in Yemen's war, which has left millions displaced and in need of medical help. Only 47 of the suspected cases have tested positive for cholera, and the outbreak has spread beyond the capital to nine other governorates. Children under 10 account for half of the cases, with six deaths from cholera and 36 associated deaths from acute watery diarrhea. Prompt treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics is crucial in severe cases.

New research suggests that habitat degradation poses a greater risk to the survival of turtles and tortoises than rising global temperatures. Over 60% of these species are listed as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered due to factors such as trading, collection for food and medicine, and habitat degradation. The study used climate models and the fossil record to investigate the impact of long-term climate change on these species. Results show that turtles and tortoises were able to withstand warmer climates in the past as long as there was enough water to support them. However, they are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, making climate change a significant threat to their conservation status.

The jury was deadlocked, with some leaning towards a conviction of voluntary manslaughter. The officer, Ray Tensing, shot Sam DuBose in the head after pulling him over for a missing license plate. Tensing testified that he feared for his life, but prosecutors argued that the evidence contradicted his story. The judge set a new hearing date to determine if the case will be retried. The DuBose family wants another trial and is disappointed with the jury's inability to reach a conclusion. The shooting has raised attention to how police deal with blacks. Legal experts say juries tend to give police officers the benefit of the doubt, but will convict if the actions were clearly unwarranted. The trial was conducted under heightened security due to the potential for unrest. The University of Cincinnati fired Tensing and reached a settlement with DuBose's family.

The largest wildfire has burned over 13,000 acres and is only 20% contained. Special health masks are being distributed in North Carolina as regular surgical masks do not provide enough protection from smoke particles. Despite the smoke, the Charlotte Marathon was able to proceed as planned. Many of the wildfires are suspected arsons, with a dark blue SUV being sought in one case. In Tennessee, 72% of active wildfires are suspected arsons. In North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, over 20 wildfires are being investigated for suspected arson. The federal government has approved funding to fight the fires in western North Carolina. In South Carolina, residents are being asked to donate drinks to help firefighters battling a wildfire.

At a global wildlife summit, a bid to provide the highest level of international legal protection to all African elephants was defeated. However, new measures were passed to add vital protection for elephants, including the closure of legal ivory markets within nations and tougher measures to deal with nations failing to control poached ivory. The debate over elephant poaching has divided African countries, with some arguing that making money from ivory sales and trophy hunting is necessary for protection, while others believe that poaching and the illegal ivory trade pose the greatest threat. Most African elephants already have the highest level of international legal protection, but elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Botswana have a lower level of protection. A proposal to upgrade these populations to the highest level of protection was defeated. The EU and some scientific and conservation groups opposed the upgrade, arguing that it did not meet the biological criteria. The issue of cutting the demand for ivory and better enforcement against poachers were highlighted as key solutions.

Something has to be done about it, and I think it starts with getting rid of corporate contributions to politicians and getting rid of lobbying. The world is dying and I think that needs to be clearly communicated to as many people as possible. Too many CEO's are thinking about their own profits. The system needs to limit their power and start focusing on the health of the species and the planet instead.	The Marrakesh Climate Talks are taking place amidst dangerously hot weather in North Africa. Record-breaking temperatures this summer have raised concerns about the impact of climate change on the region. Even if warming is limited to 2°C, the Mediterranean region would still experience unprecedented changes. Morocco could face increased temperatures and drought, leading to the displacement of forests and expansion of deserts. The fossil fuel industry's recklessness is pushing the planet towards catastrophe, and urgent action is needed to address this. Governments must divest from climate destruction and invest in renewable energy. Ending fossil fuel subsidies and removing the industry's influence from climate talks are crucial steps. Legal action is also being taken against major carbon emitters. The demand to world leaders is to stop new fossil fuel projects and transition to 100% renewable energy.

The Kenyan government has deported a senior South Sudan opposition member, James Gatdet Dak, despite threats against him. This comes after the UN dismissed the Kenyan general in charge of the peacekeeping force in South Sudan for failing to protect civilians during recent violence. Dak, a spokesman for the main South Sudanese rebel group, expressed support for the removal of the Kenyan top officer in the UN mission in South Sudan in a Facebook post. The conflict in South Sudan has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and displacement of hundreds of thousands. Human rights experts warn that Dak is at risk in South Sudan. Kenya has threatened to withdraw its peacekeeping troops from South Sudan following the dismissal of their general. The row between the UN and the Kenyan government highlights the tense relations between the two.

A strong earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4 shook Chile, but there were no reports of damage or injury. The possibility of a tsunami was also discounted. The quake occurred south of Santiago and at a depth of 54 miles. Chile's navy stated that a tsunami was unlikely. Chile has a history of earthquakes, with a devastating one in 2010 that killed over 500 people. The country has since improved its alert systems for earthquakes and tsunamis.

A study from the University of Copenhagen has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study, which tracked one million Danish women for 13 years, found that women taking the combined oral contraceptive were 23% more likely to be diagnosed with depression, while those using progestin-only pills were 34% more likely. Teens were at the greatest risk, with an 80% increase in depression when taking the combined pill. Other hormone-based methods, such as the hormonal IUS/coil, the patch, and the ring, were shown to increase depression at a higher rate than oral contraceptives. The study suggests that the practice of encouraging teens to use these alternatives to the pill is misguided. The medical community's response to the study has been dismissive, with experts downplaying the link and offering paternalistic advice. The burden of avoiding unwanted pregnancy falls on women, despite the potential negative effects on their health and wellbeing. Effective alternatives to hormonal contraceptives exist, but they are often overlooked. It is important to remember that women are twice as likely to experience depression as men, and blaming women's depression on their biological femaleness is acceptable, but blaming medication formulated from synthetic hormones is not. The study's authors plan to research the possible association between hormonal birth control and suicide attempts or completions. While not every woman experiences depression and anxiety from hormonal contraceptives, it is important to acknowledge that many do, and their lives could be improved by recognizing and addressing this issue.

"A British banker, Rurik Jutting, has been found guilty of murdering two Indonesian women in Hong Kong. The jury returned unanimous verdicts after a two-week trial, highlighting the significant inequality in Hong Kong and the decadent lifestyles of some expatriates. Jutting, who was sentenced to life in prison, has the right to appeal but has indicated that he will request a transfer to a British prison. The judge described the case as one of the most horrifying murder cases in Hong Kong and called Jutting an ""archetypal sexual predator."" The families of the victims welcomed the verdict but expressed that the sentence does not compare to the pain they have endured."

Islamic State militants in Iraq are kidnapping thousands of villagers and using them as human shields as they retreat towards Mosul. Those who refuse to comply are shot, while others are taken but manage to escape. The militants are also executing former policemen and army officers out of paranoia. This tactic of holding civilians hostage complicates the U.S.-led airstrikes and puts civilians at risk of being caught in crossfire. The militants have also set fire to oil wells and a sulfur plant, causing noxious fumes. As Iraqi forces advance towards Mosul, the militants are expected to put up a tough fight.

He was shot in the leg by Turkish police. The man, who carried a foot-long knife, shouted phrases such as ""I will change the Middle East!"" and ""Allahu akbar"" before running towards the embassy gate. The attacker was later identified as a 41-year-old from Konya, Turkey. There is no evidence linking him to a wider plot, and he appears to be mentally unstable with no criminal record or organizational links. A bomb squad is examining a bag the man left behind. Turkey has experienced several terrorist attacks in recent months, including a car bomb in Ankara claimed by Kurdish militants and a suicide bomb attack believed to be carried out by the Islamic State. Relations between Turkey and Israel have been improving after years of estrangement."

The text describes an undercover investigation into the exploitation of Syrian refugees and children in the garment industry in Turkey. The investigation reveals that many Syrian refugees, who lack work permits, are forced to work illegally in factories for low wages. The factories often hide workers during audits and continue exploiting them once the auditors leave. Some brands are aware of the abuses and are trying to address them, but others are unaware of the conditions in their supply chain. The investigation concludes that until brands have full visibility into their supply chain, the exploitation of refugees and children is likely to persist.

The debate in South Africa revolves around whether bike lanes are racist and classist. The lack of bike lanes in Johannesburg has led to dangerous conditions for cyclists, with many fatalities. The new mayor, Herman Mashaba, halted the construction of new bike lanes due to the cost and prioritization of basic services for the poor. Opponents argue that bike lanes symbolize a city that is not designed for everyone, while proponents see them as a way to address historical inequalities and create a more livable city. However, the implementation of bike lanes has been problematic, with misuse by taxis and cars parking in them. The issue became a political target, with bike lanes being criticized as a symbol of decadence and out-of-touch thinking. Despite the controversy, some cyclists, like Dan Khumalo, appreciate the presence of bike lanes as it makes their commutes safer.

Over 1,800 public primary schools in Delhi will close to protect children from dangerous levels of air pollution. The decision affects more than a million children. The smog is a result of burning crops, fireworks, dust, and vehicle emissions. The most dangerous particles, PM 2.5, reached 600 micrograms per cubic meter. Sustained exposure to this concentration is equivalent to smoking 40 cigarettes a day and increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, asthma, and pneumonia. The pollution has caused visible effects on children, including coughing and difficulty breathing. Foreigners and elites have expressed concern about winter air pollution, and some embassies discourage families with children from moving to Delhi. Parents have reported symptoms such as burning eyes and congestion in their children. The city has taken these measures for the first time, and they hope weather conditions will improve soon. Keeping children at home reduces their exposure to air pollution, but indoor air quality is often not much better unless doors and windows are closed and sealed.

They are accepting the possibility of a Hillary Clinton victory and a Democratic majority in the Senate. This has led to discussions about how Republicans should proceed after the election. They must decide whether to cooperate with Democrats and try to get things done, or to adopt a noncooperative strategy in hopes of regaining control in the 2018 midterm elections. There are also questions about the future of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the Supreme Court nominee. Republicans fear that Clinton will be influenced by progressive forces and that compromises will be difficult to achieve. They also worry about the dissatisfaction among their voters and the potential backlash if they work with Democrats. However, some Republicans argue that waiting until 2018 may be a better strategy. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer believes there is a moral imperative to get government working again and hopes to work with Republicans. Hillary Clinton is seen as someone capable of building relationships with Republican leaders. Overall, if Democrats win the White House and Senate, considerable effort will be needed to bring a new spirit to a gridlocked Congress.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has escalated his conflict with the Kurdish opposition by arresting at least eight members of parliament from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), including the party's two leaders. The arrests have been criticized as an assault on Turkey's democracy and have drawn condemnations from European capitals and the United Nations. The crackdown on political opponents follows a failed coup attempt in July, with tens of thousands of people being arrested or dismissed from their jobs. The government has also been targeting Kurdish opposition politicians, linking them to Kurdish militant groups. The arrests of HDP lawmakers are seen as a turning point in the government's campaign of arrests and have raised fears of greater instability in the country.

Wells Fargo Bank has admitted to firing 5,300 low-paid workers over five years for opening fake accounts to meet sales targets. The bank has faced outrage and has stalled stock awards to two top executives. Wells Fargo CEO/Chairman John Stumpf admitted to finding nearly 80,000 phony accounts in Pennsylvania. The bank claims that it did not impose fees for most of these accounts. However, former employees have reported unethical practices, such as raiding customers' private data and forging credit card application signatures. Other banks, both community banks and big multinationals, have also engaged in similar practices. Wells Fargo has stated that it has scrapped its incentive system and will come up with a new plan next year.

With just a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, major impacts are already being felt in natural systems. More than 80% of ecological processes that support healthy marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems show signs of responses to climate change. These impacts have consequences for humans, including increased pests and disease outbreaks, unpredictable changes in fisheries, and decreasing agriculture yields. Understanding the adaptive capacity in nature can help address these issues and apply the same principles to crops, livestock, and aquacultural species. The study emphasizes the need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as there are already significant and widespread impacts from climate change across biological systems.

The lawsuit claims that the cruise line failed to make a timely attempt to save him or recover his body. The husband alleges that they were subjected to homophobic taunts and slurs from crewmembers before the incident. The argument escalated, and the husband fell off the stateroom balcony, landing on a lifeboat before falling into the ocean. The complaint states that security officers failed to secure and rescue him. The Coast Guard performed a search-and-rescue operation, but the body was never found.

The study found that tinnitus is connected to hearing loss and is often not discussed with doctors. The research also shows that higher rates of tinnitus are reported in individuals with consistent exposure to loud noises, either at work or during recreational activities. Treatment options include hearing aids and psychotherapy to change the way affected individuals think about tinnitus.

I wish that everyone who decided to become a writer would learn that there is no place for opinion in the news.	The large Somali community in Minneapolis went through a rigorous screening process to enter the US, but younger generations are struggling to earn a living. Donald Trump's anti-immigrant stance is based on a false notion that the country's safety is at risk from Muslim extremists due to lax vetting policies. In reality, refugees face a lengthy screening process by the United Nations before coming to the US. However, once in the country, they receive limited support in terms of job-search help and cash assistance, making it difficult for them to integrate into the American economy. This lack of support contributes to refugee families' difficulty in escaping poverty and younger generations' sense of isolation.

He had been charged three times with domestic assault and was under a court order not to possess a firearm. The FBI stated that terrorism was not suspected. Cetin is facing five counts of first-degree murder and is expected to appear in court on Monday. The shooting has deeply affected the small city of Burlington, and the victims have not yet been publicly identified.

A new study from Harvard and Columbia universities estimates that the haze from Indonesian fires last year may have caused over 100,000 premature deaths in Southeast Asia. The previous official death toll was only 19 deaths in Indonesia. The fires, set to clear land for palm oil and pulpwood plantations, occur mainly on Sumatra and Borneo, with the haze blowing over Singapore and Malaysia. The study combined satellite data with health impact models and pollution readings to estimate that 91,600 deaths occurred in Indonesia, 6,500 in Malaysia, and 2,200 in Singapore. The study only looked at health impacts on adults and the effect of fine-particulate matter, not the impact on children or other toxins produced by the fires. Last year's fires were among the worst in memory, causing widespread illness and diplomatic tensions. In other news, Samoa experienced a rare hail storm, causing disbelief among residents who thought it was a hoax. This was only the second time hail has fallen in Samoa since records began. The storm lasted 10 to 15 minutes and produced small hail stones with no reported damage. Finally, Typhoon Meranti, the strongest typhoon to hit China this year, has left 28 people dead and 15 missing in the east of the country. The typhoon caused significant damage to houses and resulted in economic losses of over $2.5 billion.

The reason we had Polish jokes in America a few decades ago started with Russian racism towards Poles.	The bodies of former Polish President Lech Kaczynski and his wife are being exhumed as part of a new investigation into the 2010 plane crash that killed 96 prominent Poles. The ruling party, Law and Justice, led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the late president's twin brother, has cast doubt on previous investigations and believes the crash was an assassination. They are seeking evidence against former Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who they believe had some involvement. The exhumations will involve tests to determine the cause of the crash, including checking for explosives. The exhumations are controversial, with some dismissing conspiracy theories and others upset at the violation of cultural taboos. The crash occurred while the delegation was traveling to honor Polish officers murdered by the Soviet secret police during World War II.

A new review suggests that sleep disorders increase the risk of stroke and affect recovery. The study found a link between sleep breathing problems and stroke risk and recovery, but less evidence for the link between sleep-wake disorders and stroke. People with sleep disorders may be more likely to have another stroke or other health problems. For those with sleep apnea, treatment with a continuous positive airway pressure machine (CPAP) is recommended. A CDC report shows that a significant number of Americans have sleep disorders, indicating a need for public awareness and education about the importance of sleep.

Former Wells Fargo employees have described the mental health nightmares they experienced while working at the bank. Many employees suffered from stress-induced migraines, severe anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems due to the high-pressure work environment and unethical practices. Some employees were rewarded for using unethical practices to meet unrealistic sales goals, while others were constantly observed and critiqued by managers. The experiences of these employees highlight the toll that a toxic work culture can have on mental health. Wells Fargo has acknowledged its failures and is making changes to support its employees and uphold a customer-focused culture. The extreme stress and involvement in illegal activity can worsen mental health problems. Even managers at the bank experienced severe depression and anxiety. The mental health nightmares extended to employees in the mortgage division as well, with bullying, punishment, and intimidation being common. Employees were constantly measured against each other and bonuses were sometimes blocked. The lack of compassion from supervisors during personal crises led some employees to quit. The experiences of these employees have left a lasting impact on their mental health and perception of Wells Fargo.

An airline worker was shot and killed at Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport in a premeditated attack. The suspect, who appeared to die from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, knew the victim's schedule and routine. The airport was closed and flights were canceled or diverted while police investigated. The airport has high security, but it is unclear if surveillance cameras captured the shooting. The victim, Michael Winchester, was a ramp supervisor for Southwest Airlines. He was described as a former student athlete at the University of Oklahoma, and his son currently plays for the Kansas City Chiefs.

I agree with a line in the article that said ""The idea that people are still dying in 2015 of cholera is outrageous.”  I feel so heartbroken that people are dying simply because they don't have clean water and appropriate medical care."	The text discusses the ongoing debate over the best approach to fighting cholera. On one side are public health advocates who believe that vaccines can make a significant impact in preventing and treating cholera. On the other side are public health officials who argue that vaccines are not effective enough and that the focus should be on improving water and sanitation infrastructure. The World Health Organization (WHO) has tried to support both approaches but has not settled on how to fund them. Cholera is a deadly disease caused by contaminated water, and it kills about 100,000 people worldwide each year. Two oral vaccines exist, but they have limitations and do not address the underlying causes of cholera. The debate over vaccines has caused division and hindered progress in the fight against cholera. The text also mentions the history of cholera and the breakthroughs in understanding and treating the disease. It highlights the devastating cholera outbreak in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and the missed opportunity to distribute vaccines. The text concludes by mentioning new ideas and approaches, such as using mobile phones to report cholera cases and promoting water sterilization tablets.

This breaks my heart.	Two girls in Myanmar who were kept prisoner and tortured for five years in a tailor shop have sparked outrage and an investigation. The police had previously refused to get involved despite pleas from the girls' families. The girls, who were sent to work in the shop at the ages of 11 and 12, were denied contact with their parents, not paid, and subjected to abuse. The case highlights the issue of child slavery in Myanmar, where at least a million children are forced to give up education and work. The authorities' handling of the case has angered the public, who see it as evidence of a biased judicial system. It was only when a journalist got involved that action was taken, leading to the arrest of the tailor and her two adult children. The president has ordered a report on how the police handled the case and is taking a closer look at the work of the human rights commission. The journalist involved is receiving a presidential award for his efforts.

Germany, which took in more asylum seekers than the rest of Europe combined, is facing the challenge of deciding who gets to stay. Syrians and Iraqis are almost guaranteed sanctuary, while Nigerians and Pakistanis are more likely to have their claims rejected. Even Syrians are increasingly falling short of winning full refugee status. Critics argue that asylum officials are turning a deaf ear to genuine petitions from asylum seekers arriving from countries outside the Middle East war zones. The German government is increasingly targeting migrants deemed ineligible for protection and is enforcing deportation more strictly. The system is flawed, with many appeals against the Federal Office's decisions and concerns about inexperienced decision-makers and declining interpreter quality.

Arctic sea ice levels have reached their second lowest level ever recorded, according to scientists. The drastic melt in 2016, despite stormy and cool weather conditions, has surprised experts. The ice levels fell to their lowest point this year on September 10, covering about 1.6 million square miles, almost the same as in 2007. The reduction in sea ice has significant implications for the planet's temperature, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and the Arctic ecosystem. Experts warn that if sea ice continues to decline, there may be no more sea ice within three generations. The warming oceans will result in even less sea ice each subsequent winter. The annual refreezing process has already begun, but experts predict further dramatic losses in the coming years.

Goldfish that are released into the wild can become invasive and cause serious ecological damage. In Australia's Vasse River, goldfish have thrived and grown to large sizes, with some reaching 16 inches and four pounds. Goldfish invasions have also been reported in other places like Nevada, Colorado, and Alberta. The growth rate of goldfish in the Vasse River is the fastest known in the world. The problem with goldfish invasions stems from a disconnect between how people view goldfish as cute pets and their behavior in the wild. Goldfish are capable of rapid reproduction, uprooting vegetation, disturbing sediment, and transmitting diseases and parasites. Eradicating goldfish is difficult once they are established. Recent research has shown that goldfish are long-distance swimmers and migrate to spawn. Understanding goldfish behavior can help inform management strategies. It is crucial for pet owners to responsibly dispose of unwanted fish to prevent further invasions. Flushing fish down the toilet is not recommended.

She is known for her massive photography collection that memorializes the lives of Holocaust victims rather than focusing on their deaths. The collection, displayed in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, includes a photo of a young Yaffa Eliach taken on the day her home town was occupied by Germans. She was one of the few survivors from her town and spent years collecting photographs and documentation of every Jew who lived there. The collection became a principal exhibition at the Holocaust Museum and was installed in a tower. Eliach insisted that no photo be cropped, capturing people enjoying life before the massacre. She also wrote a book chronicling the history of her town. Eliach's work aimed to show the humanity of the victims and preserve their stories.

Gay men are unable to donate blood to victims of the Orlando shooting due to a year-long celibacy requirement imposed by the FDA. These regulations were implemented in 2015, supposedly ending the ban on gay men's blood, but still prevent even monogamous gay men from donating. The ban originated in 1983 during the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but the American Medical Association has called for its end, stating it is discriminatory and lacks scientific basis. Misinformation spread on social media falsely claimed the ban had been lifted in Orlando. The ban is seen as unjustified, and other countries, like Argentina, have already abolished it. The Council on American-Islamic Relations is helping to maintain blood supplies. The article calls for the end of this oppressive policy and highlights the need for continued resistance in the face of tragedy.

Three soldiers from Qatar have been killed while participating in Saudi-led military operations in Yemen. This is the largest loss of life for Qatar in the conflict since their first reported ground deployment in September. The soldiers were identified as Mohammed Awad Salim, Mohammed Dawood Khayal, and Mohammed Nasser Mohammed. The conflict in Yemen involves the internationally recognized government and the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels and forces loyal to a former president. The coalition has been conducting airstrikes since March 2015.

Simply pumping more water isn't the issue and perhaps the fact that too many people are trying to use that water source should be something that's looked into.

Overpumping of groundwater in Dhaka, Bangladesh is causing a water crisis that extends beyond the city center. The pumping has caused groundwater levels to drop significantly over the past 50 years, leading to water quality and supply issues in surrounding peri-urban and rural communities. The presence of naturally occurring arsenic in shallow groundwater further exacerbates the problem. The pumping is causing faster groundwater flow, which can transport contaminants like arsenic to deeper areas of the aquifer, even outside the city limits. This poses a threat to deep wells used for arsenic mitigation in these areas. The researchers used detailed subsurface measurements to model the geology of Dhaka and found that strong pumping and heterogeneity in the underground sediments affect the hydrology of the area. Heterogeneity refers to the way sand and clay are oriented underground and is critical to how contaminants move in groundwater. In a delta system like Bangladesh, the clay layers are chopped up, allowing water to move in unpredictable ways and creating uncertainty about well contamination. The researchers theorize that if pumping continues at current levels, some wells outside the city center could become contaminated sooner than expected. The low water levels caused by pumping could also compromise the operation of handpumps in these areas. Arsenic is tasteless, odorless, and colorless, making it difficult for communities to detect its presence in water without testing. The researchers' models showed that typical hydrogeological data used to assess well safety is not predictive in this type of heterogeneous system. This highlights the need for water quality monitoring and the development of artificial groundwater recharge methods to address the water crisis in the region.

The archive, called the Chicago Torture Archive, contains over 10,000 documents related to cases of torture between 1972 and 1991. These cases involved over 100 black men who were tortured by police officers to force confessions or intimidate witnesses. The archive, which will be housed at the University of Chicago, includes interrogations, trial files, journalism works, and records of activism. The launch of the archive coincides with recent efforts in Chicago to address police misconduct, including the passing of the Reparations for Burge Torture Victims ordinance. The archive's director hopes that the lessons learned from these cases can inform and inspire young activists. While the archive provides a comprehensive resource for studying the cases, there are concerns about privacy and whether victims and their families were made aware of the archive's existence. Despite these concerns, the archive is seen as an essential tool for academics, researchers, and historians to understand this dark chapter in Chicago's history. It also presents an opportunity for the police department to mend relationships with residents and increase transparency and accountability.

The demand for rhino horns, which are used in traditional medicine and high-end ornaments, has led to a spike in poaching. The South African government has declared rhino poaching a ""national priority crime"" and has implemented initiatives to combat the problem. Private rhino owners have spent millions of dollars on security measures, but the fight against poaching remains challenging. The security industry plays a crucial role in protecting rhinos on private game reserves, but there are concerns about the escalating conflict and the potential for violence.

"Multiple studies show that Trump's sexist rhetoric can have a significant impact on thinking, stress, and self-esteem. Women have expressed feeling gross and objectified by his comments, and even trauma victims have been distressed by his behavior. Trump's defense that his words are ""just words"" or ""locker room talk"" does not render them harmless, as rude language can impair cognition and lead to less creative thinking. Uncivil political discourse, especially in a presidential debate, undermines trust in government and discourages women from running for office. Discriminatory speech has negative consequences for women, leading to anger, depression, and lower self-esteem. Different types of discrimination can compound each other, with women of color experiencing even greater harm. Trump's candidacy exposes the bleak state of gender relations in the US and raises questions about how sexism will be taken seriously in the future."

Millions of trees across the United States are dying due to a combination of factors including disease, insects, drought, and wildfires, all exacerbated by climate change. One example is the rapid ohi'a death disease in Hawaii, which has infected nearly 50,000 acres of native forest. The cause of this disease is still unknown, and scientists are struggling to find a treatment. In California, an invasive pathogen called Sudden Oak Death is killing millions of trees, including redwoods. Bark beetles and mountain pine beetles are also wreaking havoc on forests, expanding their range due to climate change. The loss of trees has far-reaching consequences, affecting clean water, carbon storage, and entire ecosystems. Scientists are working on genetic research to understand why some trees are able to survive these threats, but they warn that in a few decades, American forests may be unrecognizable.

The Pilcomayo River in Paraguay is experiencing an extensive die-off of caiman, fish, and other river creatures due to a combination of drought and mismanagement. Up to 98% of caimans and 80% of capybaras are suspected dead. The river has dried up for nearly 435 miles and the government has declared an environmental emergency. The mismanagement of water resources and infrastructure by both Paraguay and Argentina has exacerbated the crisis. The river's wandering behavior and the significant amount of sediment it transports downstream have contributed to the blockage and dispersal of the river outside its channel. The government is working to find a solution, but there is no water to release or divert. Zimbabwe plans to sell its wildlife, including elephants and possibly endangered African wild dogs, to replenish its coffers due to cash shortages and a drought. Critics argue that the mismanagement of the economy and lack of accountability make this plan unworkable.

A new study from the University of Washington, funded by NASA and other agencies, reveals that all 19 polar bear populations across the Arctic are facing a shorter sea ice season. The study, which is the first to quantify the sea ice changes in each polar bear subpopulation, shows a trend towards earlier sea ice melt in the spring and later ice growth in the fall. These changes negatively impact the feeding and breeding capabilities of the bears, as they rely on the sea ice for essential activities such as hunting and traveling. The study also found that the critical timing of the sea ice break-up and freeze-up is changing in all areas, which is harmful for polar bears. The researchers recommend that the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance be incorporated as measures of climate change in future reports.

Prosecutors argue that Harris left his son in the car for seven hours because he was pursuing extramarital affairs. Defense attorneys admit Harris's philandering but argue that his son's death was a tragic accident. The fate of Harris is now in the hands of the jurors. The trial has gained significant publicity, leading to the proceedings being moved 300 miles away. Harris faces charges of malice murder, felony murder, and cruelty to children. The prosecution emphasized Harris's illicit chats with women, including underage girls, on the day of his son's death. The defense argues that Harris's sexual behavior is unrelated to the death. The prosecution highlighted the position of the car seat as evidence that Harris could see his son. The defense claims that the investigation was biased and misled the jurors.

A security crackdown in northern Rakhine state, Burma, following militant attacks has worsened the humanitarian situation and drawn international attention to Aung San Suu Kyi's government. The government has accused the Rohingya Muslim community of being behind the attacks, leading to a manhunt and reports of abuse by the military. The United Nations and the US have called for investigations into the alleged abuse and the restoration of humanitarian access. Human Rights Watch has reported burned villages and alleged rape of Muslim women by soldiers. The crisis is seen as a major test for Suu Kyi's new government, which is accused of not doing enough to address the Rohingya crisis. The Rohingya, who are essentially stateless, are considered illegal immigrants by many in the Buddhist-majority country. The security crackdown has displaced thousands of people and disrupted access to healthcare and food assistance. Suu Kyi has called for strengthening border security, following the rule of law, and creating a development plan for the area. However, the Rohingya community does not believe there is a militant group operating in the state and accuses the government of deliberate assassination. The crisis has further eroded confidence in Suu Kyi's government among the affected population.

Venezuela is currently facing political turmoil as President Nicolas Maduro's version of chavismo has brought chaos to the country and turned voters against him. The opposition has been pushing for a recall referendum to remove Maduro from power, but the government has been delaying and suspending the process. Venezuelans have taken to the streets in protest, but security forces and government sympathizers have responded violently. The military and paramilitary groups continue to support Maduro, but there are signs of cultural differences and potential divisions within the military. The opposition is calling for dialogue and negotiations, but many see it as a stalling tactic. The situation in Venezuela is uncertain and the future remains unclear.

"Filmmaker and activist Michael Moore wrote a ""Morning After To-Do List"" for Democrats, urging them to fire pundits, pollsters, and media members who clung to an incorrect election narrative. He also called for Democrats to remove any members of Congress who aren't ready to fight and to remind people that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. Moore argued that Trump's victory was not a surprise, as he had predicted it in his film ""Michael Moore in TrumpLand."" He attributed Trump's success to the anger and despair of working-class Americans who have been neglected by both parties.

Over 14,000 Saudi women have signed a petition calling for an end to the country's male guardianship system, which requires women to have the consent of a male guardian for various activities. The campaign gained support online through a trending Twitter hashtag. Women in Saudi Arabia must obtain permission from a male relative for activities such as traveling, working, studying, and even leaving the country. The petition was delivered to the government, and the activists are awaiting a response. The male guardianship system also affects women's ability to rent a flat, seek medical treatment, or file a legal claim. The campaign has received an incredible response, with hundreds of women bombarding the Saudi King's office with telegrams supporting the cause. However, there is opposition from some Saudi women who argue for reforming the system. The activists are demanding that women be treated as full citizens and that an age between 18 and 21 be designated as the point at which a woman is considered an adult. There has been no official response to the petition yet.

Protesters in New Delhi took to the streets to express their anger at the government's slow response to the city's severe air pollution crisis. The toxic smoke, caused by factors such as low winds, holiday fireworks residue, and crop-burning in neighboring states, has led to the closure of schools, canceled cricket matches, and a surge in patients with breathing problems. The air quality, measured by the PM 2.5 particulate pollutant, was more than six times the acceptable level. The city's chief minister announced emergency measures, including banning construction activity, limiting diesel-generator use, and closing a coal-fired power plant. However, experts argue that more long-term solutions are needed, such as expanding public transport and permanently closing aging coal-fired plants. The burning of crop waste in neighboring states is a major contributor to the pollution, and the government is being urged to take action. Protesters, including schoolchildren, are demanding immediate action to address the pollution crisis.

The US-backed air campaign in Yemen has been accused of war crimes, with rights groups and UN officials stating that the coalition has disregarded civilian casualties and failed to distinguish between civilian and military targets. Nearly 4,000 civilians have been killed in the war, with 60% of them dying in airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition. The war has caused widespread hunger and displacement, and warplanes have targeted medical centers, schools, and infrastructure. The US provides intelligence and logistical help to Saudi Arabia, but has reduced the number of military personnel advising the coalition. The coalition claims to investigate violations, but critics argue that the backing from the US and international community has given them a free rein. The strike on a hospital in Abs exemplifies the problems with the airstrikes, as the hospital was on a list of sites not to be targeted and had markings to indicate it was a medical facility. The strike has had a significant impact, with Doctors Without Borders pulling its personnel from northern Yemen and leaving the Abs hospital closed. Experts argue that the strikes on the taxi and hospital constitute war crimes.

The victim, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, expressed her anger and frustration at the abuser's short sentence. The father, driven by rage and a desire for vengeance, shot and killed the abuser. The father pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and also pleaded guilty to attempted murder of another man. The father's actions sparked a debate online, with some supporting him and others condemning his actions. The daughter praised her father for protecting her and sparing her from having to relive the abuse in court.

India's tiger population, which accounts for more than half of the world's total, has been rapidly declining due to human interference. While the population had been increasing in recent years, with 2,226 tigers in 2015 compared to 1,411 in 2005, this year has seen a significant increase in tiger deaths. 78 tigers have already died in the first 10 months of the year, surpassing the number of deaths in the same period over the past six years. The cause of some deaths is still being determined, but others have been attributed to human activities such as poaching, poisoning, electrocution, and road accidents. India has seized the largest number of tigers and tiger products, with 540 seizures between 2000 and 2015. The increase in tiger mortalities and seizures is a cause for concern, and experts emphasize the need for coordinated enforcement operations to combat illegal wildlife trade, which they describe as a transnational organized crime.

Rescue teams are working to save more people trapped in the rubble of a collapsed 10-storey building in Kisii Town. The death toll currently stands at nine, with hopes of finding more survivors. The rescue efforts are being coordinated by the Kenya Defence Forces, Kenya Red Cross, and St-John Ambulance personnel. It is suspected that drilling underneath the building may have caused its collapse. The developer of the building is currently in hiding, and authorities are urging him to surrender for investigation. The blame game between the county and national governments has been criticized, with the focus being on rescue operations. Efforts are being made to save those still trapped, with additional tools and machinery ordered. The NCA is assessing adjacent buildings for safety, as they pose a danger to the rescue operations. All buildings in Kisii Town will be assessed to ensure their safety, and contractors are warned against violating construction procedures. This is the second incident this year, following the collapse in Huruma, Nairobi County. The developer of the Kisii building is being blamed for ignoring NCA warnings.

"Prominent Republican women are concerned that defending Donald Trump against accusations of sexual assault is damaging the party's relationship with female voters. Trump's comments about women have been a source of concern throughout his campaign, but the release of a 2005 video and subsequent allegations by 11 women have escalated the issue. Many male Republicans have come to Trump's defense, dismissing the accusers and potentially alienating female voters. This division within the party comes as polls show that women are supporting Hillary Clinton by a significant margin. Female Republican strategists and politicians, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Carly Fiorina, have distanced themselves from Trump. The recent interview between Newt Gingrich and Megyn Kelly further highlighted the party's struggle with women voters. Republican women are increasingly feeling that the party does not represent them and are critical of the party's handling of Trump's behavior. The GOP's treatment of women is playing into the ""war on women"" narrative that Democrats have pushed in the past. Trump's personal attacks on women, both in the media and on social media, have also contributed to the party's struggle with female voters. Overall, many Republican women believe that the party is not doing enough to address the concerns of female voters and that this will have negative consequences for the party in the general election."

I can't wait for lab grown meat to be the standard, but that's not really in this. So, read away about cow farts.	Cows release methane gas, a greenhouse gas, which has a much higher negative effect on the climate compared to carbon dioxide. The livestock industry, including cattle breeding and farming, is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector. Livestock pastures and feed production use a significant portion of the Earth's land surface, leading to deforestation and habitat loss. The increasing demand for meat and dairy products contributes to the overgrowth of the farming industry and its impact on global warming. Producing one kilogram of beef emits an equivalent amount of CO2 as an average European car every 250 kilometers and consumes a significant amount of energy. Consuming less meat and dairy products is an effective way to reduce one's carbon footprint and protect the environment.

The study found that 25.1% of eye infection cases were linked to misuse of contact lenses, including sleeping in them or wearing them for longer than recommended. Other forms of misuse included using expired lenses, storing lenses in tap water, and wearing them while swimming. The CDC warns that sleeping in contact lenses can increase the risk of infections, and wearers of daily disposable lenses have a lower risk.

One year after a dam ruptured in Brazil, causing a massive mudslide and environmental disaster, the people living along the affected river are still afraid to drink the water and eat the fish. The mudslide buried towns, killed 19 people, and caused extensive damage to the environment. The cleanup efforts by the mining company responsible have been slow and ineffective, and doubts remain about the safety of the river water. The government's priority now is to reforest the river banks to prevent further contamination. Many businesses, including fishing and steelmaking, rely on the river, and fishermen who lost their livelihoods receive compensation. However, many fishermen have lost hope of ever fishing in the river again.

It is really sad to see children being born with microphely. I really hope something will be done.	The future of the Zika virus is uncertain. Experts have different opinions on how long it will stick around and how often it will return. Some believe it will behave like other arboviruses, recurring regularly with upticks in cases during the rainy season. Others predict that it will vanish in a few years, similar to chikungunya. The current outbreak in the Americas is due to the fact that people in the region had no immunity to the virus. Future outbreaks may be smaller if people develop immunity, but there could also be long lulls between outbreaks, allowing for a buildup of younger people who aren't immune. It is unclear if there will be fewer cases of microcephaly in the future due to the immunity gained from Zika infections. The impact of mosquito control efforts on young girls getting infected is also uncertain. It is unknown if Zika will strike Africa and Asia with the same ferocity as the Americas, but experts believe the two strains of Zika will be cross-protective. The uncertainty surrounding Zika's future affects the prospects for a vaccine. If Zika activity subsides, it will be difficult to conduct clinical trials to prove the vaccine's effectiveness. However, the fear of the virus's impact on developing fetuses may continue to drive demand for a vaccine.

The United Nations has expressed concern over the sharp increase in civilian casualties in Yemen since peace talks collapsed last month. The majority of these casualties were caused by airstrikes from a coalition led by Saudi Arabia. At least 329 civilians have been killed and 426 injured since the beginning of August. Saudi Arabia and its allies are trying to prevent an international investigation into possible war crimes. The United States and Britain, major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia, are finding it harder to ignore the bloodshed. The most recent example of the carnage was an airstrike on a market and residential area in Hodeidah, which killed at least 26 civilians. The United Nations has documented numerous attacks on civilian facilities by both coalition and rebel forces. Doctors Without Borders has pulled staff members out of six hospitals in Yemen after coalition planes bombed a facility. The United Nations has also expressed concern over the blockade of the city of Taiz, which has left residents critically short of food and water. The majority of civilian casualties have been caused by the Saudi-led coalition, according to a report to the Human Rights Council. Saudi Arabia and President Hadi's government have condemned the report as biased and have proposed a Yemeni commission to investigate human rights violations. Rights groups argue that a national body lacks expertise and that its reporting falls short of international standards. The European Union has drafted a competing resolution calling for a United Nations mission to Yemen. The Council will decide how to proceed after a week of diplomatic negotiations. President Hadi accused Iran of blocking the path towards peace in Yemen.

I remember this happened around the crisis here back in 2009 and everything was settled rather quickly.	A gas shortage in the Southeastern United States has caused long lines at gas stations and limited availability of fuel. The shortage was caused by a leak in a pipeline that runs from Houston to New Jersey, resulting in over 300,000 gallons of gas being leaked. The states affected by the shortage include Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas. While prices have increased, they are still below $2.50 per gallon in many areas. The shortage has led to panic and frustration among drivers, with some gas stations completely running out of fuel. Efforts are being made to address the shortage, including repairs to the pipeline and alternative methods of transporting gasoline.

At least 55 people have died and dozens are missing after a boat carrying migrants capsized off the coast of Egypt. The boat, which was overcrowded with up to 450 migrants, sank near the city of Rosetta. So far, 163 survivors have been rescued and four suspected human traffickers have been arrested. The search for more survivors will focus on the boat's cold storage room, where witnesses say around 100 people were trapped. This incident highlights the dangerous journey that migrants are taking to reach Europe, with Egypt becoming an increasingly popular departure point.

A mass grave containing the bodies of hundreds of Iraqi policemen who were executed by ISIS has been discovered near Mosul. The grave was found by Iraqi security forces during their assault on the ISIS stronghold. The bodies are believed to have been buried as recently as October, just before the US-backed forces began their assault on Mosul. The grave was visited by Human Rights Watch, who found four exposed corpses and piles of rubbish covering other bodies. Witnesses reported that ISIS rounded up around 2,000 people from the area and forced them to head towards Mosul, separating the former policemen and driving them away. Gunfire and screams were heard on multiple occasions, indicating further executions. Human Rights Watch has called for ISIS to be held accountable for these crimes against humanity.

Actress Susan Sarandon has launched an online petition urging people to empty their bank accounts in protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

A palm oil company named PT Mohairson Pawan Khatulistiwa plans to clear more than half of the Sungai Putri forest in Indonesia, which is home to a critically endangered orangutan population. Despite the Indonesian government's commitment to protecting peat, forests, and orangutans, the company has been granted a license to destroy the forest. The forest is at risk of being converted into an industrial tree plantation, and the company has already started work on building a drainage canal. The destruction of the forest and the orangutans' habitat is incompatible with Indonesia's national action plan for orangutans. The development violates Indonesia's legal processes and international commitments. Improved management is needed in Sungai Putri to address illegal logging and fires. There are conflicting opinions on the deforestation, with some supporting it for potential employment opportunities and compensation, while others argue that it is unsustainable. Alternative solutions that involve collaboration between various stakeholders are available to fulfill development objectives and alleviate poverty in Indonesia.

I hope that it can help you out a little bit with what you have been going through.	Sleep paralysis is a common sleep problem that affects around 8% of the population. It occurs when a person is awake and conscious but unable to move, except for their eyes. Sleep paralysis often involves nightmares or hallucinations and can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The causes of sleep paralysis are not fully understood, but stress and disruptions to sleep, such as alcohol or caffeine, can increase the risk. It can also be a symptom of other sleep disorders and mental health conditions. Kendall Jenner discussed her struggles with sleep paralysis, which may be linked to her anxiety and jet lag. Sleep paralysis is more common in people with mental health problems and young adults. For most people, it is not a chronic condition, but some individuals experience recurrent episodes. Practicing good sleep behaviors, such as avoiding alcohol and caffeine and sleeping on your side, can help prevent sleep paralysis. If it becomes a problem, a specialist may be able to prescribe medications to suppress REM sleep and alleviate symptoms.

"PTSD is a misunderstood and stigmatized disorder that affects many veterans. It is estimated that 8 million Americans suffer from PTSD, with rates among Vietnam War and Iraq War veterans being particularly high. The negative connotations surrounding PTSD prevent many veterans from seeking help. Veterans want others to know that referring to them as ""weak"" is ignorant, as war experiences are incomprehensible to those who haven't lived through them. PTSD symptoms can be masked and go unnoticed, making it difficult to recognize. Many PTSD sufferers suffer in silence, fearing judgment and trying to appear strong.

"The US is facing an ""innovation crisis"" as other countries outperform it in measures of innovation. Economists attribute this decline to burdensome regulations and a weak job market. Some argue that the US's focus on individual self-reliance and smaller social safety net may discourage risk-taking. Studies show that demand-side factors, such as job insecurity and middling wage growth, are affecting entrepreneurship. Canada's maternity leave reform and France's unemployment insurance reform offer potential solutions to boost entrepreneurship. Policies that promote a tight labor market and full employment are crucial for the future strength of the US economy."

These acts include physical harm, hate speech, and racist graffiti. Trump supporters feel empowered to express their disdain for those they dislike or deem insignificant. It is crucial for America to stand united against these attacks and promote a message of intolerance towards hate.

Then the gorilla picked up the boy and carried him a little bit. They actually ended up shooting the gorilla which is so sad.	A federal report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has concluded that the barrier separating humans and primates at the Cincinnati Zoo was not in compliance with standards for housing primates when a child fell into the gorilla exhibit in May. The report issued a critical citation because the barrier failed and caused harm to an animal. However, before the incident, the zoo had not been cited for shortcomings with the barrier during previous inspections. The zoo has since updated the barrier and is now in compliance with federal standards. The family of the child who entered the enclosure has stated that they do not want to pursue legal action against the zoo. The USDA has issued 10 citations at the zoo in the last three years, but none were related to the gorilla exhibit. The Cincinnati Zoo officials have reaffirmed their commitment to the well-being of the animals and the safety of visitors. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) has stated that the zoo meets their standards related to barriers.

Something should not have to affect you in order for it to matter. There are things that are a lot more important than your coffee fix. For instance, the people-like the people in the story-whose livelihoods are being put in danger because of global warming.	A report commissioned by Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand warns that climate change poses a significant threat to the world's coffee supply. The report highlights the impact of warming temperatures on farmland, which will reduce the global area suitable for coffee by about 50%. It also emphasizes the increased risk of diseases and pests, such as coffee rust and the coffee berry borer. Major coffee companies have been aware of these threats for years and have been implementing support programs for coffee growers. However, the report suggests that no single company is large enough to tackle the challenge of climate change on its own. The World Coffee Research group is developing adaptive strategies to address the issue, including preserving genetic diversity, creating a variety catalog, and evaluating new coffee varieties. Despite these efforts, there are still major gaps in knowledge on how to best help coffee producers adapt to climate change. The report raises concerns about the livelihoods of the 125 million people worldwide who depend on coffee, particularly those in developing countries. Urgent action is needed to prevent devastating consequences for these communities.

Last year, Mayweather was ranked as the highest-paid celebrity, earning $300 million, but has since retired from boxing and currently sits at No. 54 on Forbes' list with $44 million earned in the last 12 months.

The incident highlights a growing trend of parents using drugs with their children in the car to avoid disapproval. The mother was revived with Narcan and charged with child neglect and possession of drug paraphernalia. The child now lives with his grandmother. This case is similar to a previous incident in East Liverpool, Ohio, where a couple overdosed with their 4-year-old son in the car. The police hope that sharing these photos will discourage drug users from endangering children. The opioid crisis continues to claim the lives of about 78 Americans every day.

The Forest Service has allowed heavy grazing and repeated violations on these public lands, despite acknowledging in 2003 that grazing was causing significant harm to resources. The lawsuit aims to protect the sensitive habitat for various fish species and improve management of the watershed. The grazing has also impacted recreational opportunities in the area. The groups are urging the Forest Service to take action and prioritize the preservation of these lands.

The Islamic State (ISIS) has used a rocket containing mustard gas against U.S. troops in Iraq, according to a top U.S. military official. This is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S. forces in Iraq, although ISIS has previously used chemical weapons. The U.S. military recently attacked a former pharmaceutical plant near Mosul that ISIS was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals. No soldiers were injured in the attack, and there have been no symptoms of exposure to mustard gas. Both ISIS and President Bashar al-Assad in Syria have been accused of using chemical weapons. The fighting around Mosul is expected to intensify as Iraqi forces, supported by U.S. soldiers, advance into the city.

Lesin, a former aide of Russian President Vladimir Putin, died from head injuries sustained in accidental falls after excessive drinking, according to authorities in Washington. Lesin, who helped create the Kremlin's Russia Today television network, was found dead in a D.C. hotel room in November 2015. Initially ruled as ""undetermined,"" the manner of death has now been amended to an accident with acute ethanol intoxication as a contributing cause. Lesin's death was caused by blunt-force injuries to his head, as well as injuries to his neck, torso, arms, and legs from falls. The investigation determined that Lesin entered his hotel room for the final time after days of excessive alcohol consumption and was found dead the next morning. The ruling of accidental death has been accepted by the interim D.C. police chief. Lesin was known for his role in the Kremlin-dominated media landscape and his volatile temper. He resigned as head of Gazprom-Media in 2014 and kept a low profile until his death. Speculation about his death included theories of foul play due to his land dealings in California, but a friend and business associate believed he died after heavy drinking."

"The Great Barrier Reef, although severely damaged, is not completely dead. It is currently on ""life support"" due to coral bleaching. The reef is home to numerous species and is considered the world's largest living thing. Preliminary findings show that 22% of its coral has died from the bleaching event. Climate change is the main cause of coral bleaching, as it leads to the expulsion of algae from the corals. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is conducting surveys to assess the impact of the bleaching. While scientists have expressed concerns about the reef's future, it is not beyond saving. The reef supports 70,000 jobs in reef tourism, and large sections of it are still in reasonable shape. The focus should be on better protecting the reef rather than giving up on it."

The mental health care provided to detainees at Guantánamo Bay has been compromised by a lack of training, ethical boundaries, and information about their treatment during interrogations. Psychiatrists and psychologists were often unaware of the abuse that had taken place, and were discouraged from asking detainees about their experiences. The quality of care has been criticized by human rights groups and defense teams, who argue that it has been negligent and ineffective. Many detainees suffer from psychological problems as a result of their treatment, but PTSD is rarely diagnosed due to the impracticality of treatment in the prison environment. The mental health personnel faced numerous challenges, including distrust from detainees and the blurred lines between medical care and interrogation. Despite these obstacles, they did their best to provide care to the prisoners.

Experts are assessing the potential impact on the environment, particularly on seabird species. A full report and monitoring of the situation are requested.

Nosey, a 34-year-old female African elephant, has been held captive and subjected to decades of abuse. She has been forced to live in solitary confinement, perform in circuses, and give rides to people. This has caused significant stress to her physical and psychological well-being. Nosey has spent most of her life in a small trailer, receiving little exercise and no socialization. She has developed arthritis due to her long-term confinement. Despite over 200 citations and 30 violations of the Animal Welfare Act by her owner, Hugo Tommy Liebel, the USDA has not taken action. Nosey is suffering from chronic, untreated health problems and lives in pain. The USDA has the power and responsibility to respond to citizen complaints and confiscate Nosey, releasing her into a proper elephant sanctuary. Immediate action is needed to end the daily abuse of this animal.

According to FBI data, murders in the US increased by 10.8% in 2015, the largest single-year percentage jump since 1971. The rise in violence was driven by an increase in the murders of black men and an increase in gun murders. The number of firearm murders increased by roughly 1,500, while knife murders dropped slightly. The percentage of murders committed with guns increased to 71.5%. Despite the increase in murders, overall crime rates did not increase substantially. The attorney general mentioned the overall increase in violent crime but did not mention the increase in murders. A third of the murder increase was driven by ten larger cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Black men and women face less violence today than in the early 1990s. In a separate incident, two New Jersey Transit buses crashed in the Lincoln Tunnel, injuring as many as 44 people.

Thompson criticized Johnson for focusing on the construction of the Golden 1 Center instead of projects that benefit the community. Johnson's Chief of Staff denied claims that the mayor violently attacked Thompson. Thompson expressed regret for promoting violence but still stands by his actions. He believes the money spent on the arena should have been used for public schools, community development, or helping the homeless.

The bombings killed about 100 people and knocked out running water for two million people. Efforts at the United Nations to revive a cease-fire collapsed, and hopes for humanitarian relief faded. The bombings left residents buried in debris and turned neighborhoods into rubble. The Syrian government announced a new offensive, including a ground operation, but analysts doubt their ability to seize and hold significant territory. Diplomatic efforts between Russia and the United States also disintegrated. The situation in Aleppo continues to worsen, with no end in sight.

The drastic melt in 2016, despite stormy and cool weather conditions, has surprised experts. The ice levels fell to their lowest point this year on September 10, covering about 1.6 million square miles, almost the same as in 2007. The reduction in sea ice has significant implications for the planet's temperature, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and the Arctic ecosystem. Experts warn that if sea ice continues to decline, there may be no more sea ice within three generations. The warming oceans will result in even less sea ice each subsequent winter. The annual refreezing process has already begun, but experts predict further dramatic losses in the coming years.

A new study reveals that U.S. veterans have a high prevalence of sleep disorders, with sixteen percent of veterans with PTSD experiencing sleep disorders. The prevalence of sleep disorders among veterans has increased from less than one percent in 2000 to about six percent in 2010. Sleep apnea is the most common sleep disorder among veterans, followed by insomnia. Veterans with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic diseases also have higher rates of sleep disorders. The study did not establish a direct link between PTSD and sleep disorders, but a follow-up study will examine this connection.

Two soldiers were killed by attackers armed with guns, knives, and spears. In retaliation, the government used helicopters to fire at the attackers. The area is closed to Western journalists, making it difficult to verify the scale of the fighting. The Rohingya have been under siege since the government sent security forces to hunt for armed Rohingya assailants who had killed nine police officers. Human rights groups have received reports of killings, rapes, and beatings of Rohingya civilians. Western diplomats have called for an independent investigation into the violence, but Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has declined. The Rohingya population has been subjected to decades of repression, making them susceptible to radicalization. The government's harsh proposals may have been the catalyst for the recent attacks. The Rohingya villages have become armed camps, with reports of food scarcity, curfews, and rape by soldiers. Myanmar officials deny the occurrence of rapes.

"France's President Francois Hollande has announced plans to completely shut down the migrant camp known as ""the Jungle"" in Calais. He has called on London to help deal with the thousands of people living in squalor in the camp, whose ultimate goal is to reach Britain. France intends to relocate the migrants in small groups around the country, but right-wing opponents accuse Hollande of mismanaging a problem that they believe is Britain's responsibility. Hollande reminded Britain that if France stopped preventing migrants from entering Britain, it would be obliged to deal with the matter when asylum-seekers arrive on its shores. He expects London to honor agreements on managing the flow of migrants."

This year, a record number of people have drowned in the Mediterranean while attempting to escape war and seek a better life. Over 3,800 people have died, averaging about 90 deaths per week. The largest migration of refugees since World War II is currently taking place, with over 65 million people displaced from their homes. Despite fewer people crossing this year compared to 2015, the death toll has increased. The main routes across the Mediterranean are from Turkey to Greece, Libya to Italy, and West Africa to Spain. Syria produces the most refugees, with nearly five million fleeing the country due to civil war. The war in Syria has also resulted in an estimated 430,000 deaths. While some refugees are resettled in countries like the United States and Canada, the majority seek asylum in Europe or remain in the Middle East. With no end to the war in sight, the refugee crisis and the loss of lives will continue.

Lead damage is not reversible, and we lived in an old house. To think that every day people are drinking water with as much lead as indicated is a bit disturbing - and it's not going to be cheap to fix.	Chicago has shut down hundreds of public drinking fountains due to excessive levels of lead in the water. The ongoing crisis in Flint, Michigan has prompted other communities to test for lead, including the Chicago Park District. Testing revealed that nearly a quarter of outdoor fountains and 14 indoor fountains and sinks exceeded the federal standard for lead levels. Some fountains had lead levels 80 times higher than the permissible level. All fountains and sinks with high lead levels have been disabled and will undergo further testing and repairs. The lack of adequate testing for lead in public settings is a national problem, according to public health officials. Lead can have serious health effects, especially in young children, and there is no safe level of lead in the body. Lead pipes and fixtures are still common in communities across the country. While taking a sip from a single fountain may not seriously affect health, it can contribute to cumulative lead exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations like the homeless and children.

Keith Springer, an expert in killing small animals, is on a mission to eradicate an army of house mice that are endangering a remote colony of seabirds on Gough Island. The mice have multiplied and are feasting on the eggs and chicks of millions of seabirds, including the critically endangered Tristan albatross. Springer is working on an audacious plan to spray poison pellets from helicopters to kill the mice, but the operation is challenging and expensive. A campaign is underway to raise funds for the eradication project. If successful, the plan will save the seabirds and allow a new generation of albatrosses to thrive.

Hillary Clinton is ahead in states worth more than 270 electoral votes. The focus now is on how many down-ballot Republicans Trump will drag down with him. Republican operatives and conservative radio hosts have declared that Trump is done and there is little he can do to turn it around. Trump's deficits in national and swing state polls are unprecedented, and his ground game is weak compared to Clinton's. Early voting numbers in Arizona and the shrinking advantage of Republicans in Florida and North Carolina indicate a potential win for Clinton. However, Democrats are not taking the outcome for granted and are working hard to mobilize voters. Trump's refusal to accept the voting results and his controversial remarks have galvanized Clinton's supporters. Trump's blaming of a globalist conspiracy and claims of a rigged election have raised concerns about the integrity of the election system. Trump's downward spiral has also affected House Republicans and vulnerable Senate candidates. Overall, Republicans are scared and the race has become a ""horror show"" for them."

The large Somali community in Minneapolis went through a rigorous screening process to enter the US, but younger generations are struggling to earn a living. Donald Trump's anti-immigrant stance is based on a false notion that the country's safety is at risk from Muslim extremists due to lax vetting policies. In reality, refugees face a lengthy screening process by the United Nations before coming to the US. However, once in the country, they receive limited support in terms of job-search help and cash assistance, making it difficult for them to integrate into the American economy. This lack of support contributes to refugee families' difficulty in escaping poverty and younger generations' sense of isolation.

A study has found that humans have destroyed about 10 percent of Earth's wilderness since 1992, equivalent to an area half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of Alaska. The research team from Australia's University of Queensland defines wilderness as an area with no human development. The destruction is primarily due to activities such as logging, agriculture, mining, and oil and gas exploration. The study aims to raise awareness and calls for international policies to protect remaining wilderness areas. The loss of wilderness is particularly significant in South America, which has experienced a 30 percent decline. The researchers warn that once wilderness is gone, it cannot be restored, emphasizing the need to protect what is left. The report criticizes the United Nations and others for ignoring the problem and highlights the urgency of taking action to prevent further loss.

The jury was deadlocked, with some leaning towards a conviction of voluntary manslaughter. The officer, Ray Tensing, shot Sam DuBose in the head after pulling him over for a missing license plate.

"Prominent Republican women are concerned that defending Donald Trump against accusations of sexual assault is damaging the party's relationship with female voters. Trump's comments about women have been a source of concern throughout his campaign, but the release of a 2005 video and subsequent allegations by 11 women have escalated the issue. Many male Republicans have come to Trump's defense, dismissing the accusers and potentially alienating female voters. This division within the party comes as polls show that women are supporting Hillary Clinton by a significant margin. Female Republican strategists and politicians, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Carly Fiorina, have distanced themselves from Trump. The recent interview between Newt Gingrich and Megyn Kelly further highlighted the party's struggle with women voters. Republican women are increasingly feeling that the party does not represent them and are critical of the party's handling of Trump's behavior. The GOP's treatment of women is playing into the ""war on women"" narrative that Democrats have pushed in the past. Trump's personal attacks on women, both in the media and on social media, have also contributed to the party's struggle with female voters. Overall, many Republican women believe that the party is not doing enough to address the concerns of female voters and that this will have negative consequences for the party in the general election."

"The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has reported that levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have surpassed an important threshold and are unlikely to dip below it for ""many generations"". The 400 parts per million benchmark was broken globally for the first time in recorded history in 2015, and 2016 is expected to be the first full year to exceed this mark. The increase in CO2 levels can be attributed to a strong El Niño event, which caused drought conditions in tropical regions, reducing the ability of vegetation to absorb CO2. Additionally, there were extra emissions from fires sparked by the drier conditions. The WMO emphasizes the need to focus on cutting CO2 emissions in order to tackle climate change and keep temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius."

The Marrakesh Climate Talks are taking place amidst dangerously hot weather in North Africa. Record-breaking temperatures this summer have raised concerns about the impact of climate change on the region. Even if warming is limited to 2°C, the Mediterranean region would still experience unprecedented changes. Morocco could face increased temperatures and drought, leading to the displacement of forests and expansion of deserts. The fossil fuel industry's recklessness is pushing the planet towards catastrophe, and urgent action is needed to address this. Governments must divest from climate destruction and invest in renewable energy. Ending fossil fuel subsidies and removing the industry's influence from climate talks are crucial steps. Legal action is also being taken against major carbon emitters. The demand to world leaders is to stop new fossil fuel projects and transition to 100% renewable energy.

Russia has claimed that the UN aid convoy that was bombed in Syria on Monday night was escorted by terrorists, denying accusations that it was behind the attack.

The Russian defense ministry released drone footage showing a pickup truck carrying militants and a heavy mortar driving alongside the convoy before it was bombed. More than a dozen people were killed, including the director of the organization. The truce collapsed as leaders were gathered at the UN in New York to negotiate a longer-term peace plan. The US accused the Syrian government and Russia of violating the ceasefire, while Moscow accused the US-led coalition of aiding ISIS.

The archive, called the Chicago Torture Archive, contains over 10,000 documents related to cases of torture between 1972 and 1991. These cases involved over 100 black men who were tortured by police officers to force confessions or intimidate witnesses. The archive, which will be housed at the University of Chicago, includes interrogations, trial files, journalism works, and records of activism. The launch of the archive coincides with recent efforts in Chicago to address police misconduct, including the passing of the Reparations for Burge Torture Victims ordinance. The archive's director hopes that the lessons learned from these cases can inform and inspire young activists. While the archive provides a comprehensive resource for studying the cases, there are concerns about privacy and whether victims and their families were made aware of the archive's existence. Despite these concerns, the archive is seen as an essential tool for academics, researchers, and historians to understand this dark chapter in Chicago's history. It also presents an opportunity for the police department to mend relationships with residents and increase transparency and accountability.

Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through.

A new study from Umeå University in Sweden found that high rates of air pollution are linked to poorer psychiatric health in children and adolescents. The researchers examined register-based data on individuals under 18 from different regions in Sweden and found that air pollution levels do impact psychiatric diagnoses in young people. The risk of having at least one psychiatric diagnosis increased with a 10 microgram per cubic meter increase in nitrogen dioxide levels in the air. Nitrogen dioxide is a harmful air pollutant that results from road traffic and fossil fuel use. Long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide has been associated with reduced lung function, respiratory problems, and increased allergy rates.

A new report by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) reveals that over 18 million Americans are supplied with drinking water that violates federal laws on lead content. The report states that the water crisis in Flint, Michigan is not an isolated incident, and that violations of national rules protecting against lead contamination are widespread. The NRDC's analysis of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows that 5,363 water systems, serving more than 18 million people, breached the federal Lead and Copper Rule in 2015. These violations include inadequate testing for lead and insufficient treatment to prevent lead from leaching into the water supply. The violations occurred in almost every state, with 1,110 community water utilities providing water that exceeded the EPA's actionable limit for lead. Despite the widespread failure of water suppliers, very few were punished by the EPA last year. Of the over 8,000 violations, enforcement action was only taken against 11% of cases, and penalties were sought for just 3% of violations. The EPA has acknowledged the challenges in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule and has intensified work with state drinking water programs. However, a revised rule will not be implemented until 2017 at the earliest. The NRDC emphasizes that unsafe drinking water is a national problem that requires a national solution. The failure of the system to detect violations is highlighted by the fact that Flint was not considered in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule last year, despite the well-known water crisis. The CDC has reported that lead levels in the blood of Flint children significantly increased after the city switched its water supply. The NRDC also revealed that water utilities often manipulate test results to downplay lead levels. The Guardian has reported that at least 33 US cities have used methods to mask the true level of lead in water tests. The report raises concerns about the extent of the issue and calls for a coordinated effort at all levels to prevent future crises.

Elizabeth Rose, who manages male models at Premier, believes it is unfair and not a form of female empowerment. She explains that women can be paid up to £40,000 for a top show, while male models only receive £10,000 on average. However, she notes that the situation is slowly changing as advertisers are increasingly using male models for grooming products. Elizabeth also highlights that the top 10 female models all make millions, whereas only the top three male models earn over a million. She tries to negotiate higher fees for male models but acknowledges that women face more discrimination due to their age. Elizabeth believes that change can happen if more agents and models refuse to accept unequal pay.

I found out that they ambush seals as they come up out of the water. Whether we can change this trend or not, I am not sure about but we should try.	A new study from the University of Washington, funded by NASA and other agencies, reveals that all 19 polar bear populations across the Arctic are facing a shorter sea ice season. The study, which is the first to quantify the sea ice changes in each polar bear subpopulation, shows a trend towards earlier sea ice melt in the spring and later ice growth in the fall. These changes negatively impact the feeding and breeding capabilities of the bears, as they rely on the sea ice for essential activities such as hunting and traveling. The study also found that the critical timing of the sea ice break-up and freeze-up is changing in all areas, which is harmful for polar bears. The researchers recommend that the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance be incorporated as measures of climate change in future reports.

Microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by malformed heads and stunted brain development, has been linked to the Zika virus. The severity of microcephaly can vary, but it often results in mental impairment. Detecting the condition before birth is difficult, leading to debates about abortion. Raising a child with microcephaly requires extensive care and support, which can be costly. Early intervention programs can help, but they often end after three years. The CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics have published guidelines for evaluating and caring for infants with Zika-related microcephaly. The cost of care for each child is estimated to be $10 million over a lifetime. Families with resources, like the Grounds family, can provide the best care for their child, but many others struggle. Nicholas, a child with microcephaly, has made progress with intensive intervention, but ongoing support is necessary. Parents of children with microcephaly need support throughout their lives. Genetic testing revealed that Nicholas inherited two mutated genes from his parents, causing microcephaly. The odds of their second child having the condition were one in four.

The reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who shot and killed a baby Salt River wild horse and wounded two others has increased to $25,000. Animal Recovery Mission, a non-profit organization, matched the existing reward fund. The Salt River Wild Horse Management Group, American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign, Humane Society of the United States, and Schill Law Firm also contributed to the reward. Despite the reward, no tips leading to the suspect's apprehension have been received. ARM Investigations, a coalition partner of the Salt River Wild Horse Management Group, decided to match the reward fund in hopes of encouraging a crucial tip. The organization fights animal cruelty and focuses on conservation programs. The witness saw a man shooting three Salt River wild horses, resulting in the death of a 6-month-old foal named Kai and injuries to two other horses. The horses are being monitored and treated by the SRWHMG. This is not the first time the wild horses of Salt River have been shot at, and the SRWHMG suspects they are being hunted. The organization is dedicated to protecting and studying the Salt River wild horses. The public can still contribute to the reward fund through a Go Fund Me page.

The vaquita, the most endangered marine mammal on Earth, is facing extinction due to gill net fishing and the illegal trade of totoaba. Urgent conservation measures were approved to protect the vaquita, including a permanent ban on gill net fishing and efforts to crack down on the totoaba trade. However, experts argue that these measures are not enough to save the species. The current plan neglects local livelihoods, fails to involve local fishermen in designing a sustainable management plan, and does not adequately address the totoaba trade. The ban on gill nets is seen as a step forward, but more interventions are needed to ensure the vaquita's recovery. This case highlights the challenges and complexities of endangered species conservation. Conservation efforts often come too late or lack the thoroughness needed to make a lasting impact. A long-term vision and proactive action are necessary to effectively conserve species and natural resources.

Nosey, a 34-year-old female African elephant, has been held captive and subjected to decades of abuse. She has been forced to live in solitary confinement, perform in circuses, and give rides to people. This has caused significant stress to her physical and psychological well-being. Nosey has spent most of her life in a small trailer, receiving little exercise and no socialization. She has developed arthritis due to her long-term confinement. Despite over 200 citations and 30 violations of the Animal Welfare Act by her owner, Hugo Tommy Liebel, the USDA has not taken action.

Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans took to the streets in Seoul for the second consecutive weekend, demanding the resignation of President Park Geun-hye. The protests were sparked by Park's admission that she shared classified information with someone lacking security clearance. The demonstrations, which included families, students, and union members, were some of the largest anti-government protests in decades. Four officers and 26 protesters were injured during the protests. Park's spokesman stated that she realizes the seriousness of the situation and is considering ways to normalize affairs. Protesters are calling for Park's resignation due to feelings of betrayal and frustration with her leadership. The protests also stem from other incidents, such as the Sewol ferry sinking. Despite roadblocks, protesters attempted to march to the presidential palace. The demonstrations will continue until there are answers and a resolution to the political turmoil.

The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has called for large-scale, long-term investment in Somalia to ensure the successful repatriation of Somali refugees from the Dadaab camp in Kenya. The Kenyan government plans to close the camp by November 30th and has accepted a request to extend the deadline by six months. However, the IRC warns that deferring the closure will not address the refugees' concerns about violence, displacement, and gender-based violence in Somalia. The IRC emphasizes the need for support and integration programs for refugees, as well as investment in Somalia to provide earning opportunities. Since the announcement of the camp's closure, the rate of refugee movement from Kenya to Somalia has increased four-fold.

Four Americans were killed in a suicide bomb attack at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. The attack also wounded 16 US service members and one Polish soldier. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it had been planned for four months. The US Embassy in Kabul will be closed as a precautionary measure. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg expressed support for those affected by the attack and reiterated NATO's commitment to fighting terrorism. Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. Urgent investigations are being carried out to determine how the attacker gained access to the base. This attack follows a series of recent attacks in Afghanistan, including a suicide car bomb targeting the German Consulate and a joint Afghan-US battle against the Taliban that resulted in civilian and military casualties.

Kesha revealed in an interview with The New York Times magazine that she was under immense pressure to maintain a party girl image and dumb down her music while working with her former producer, Dr. Luke. She also stated that she was pressured to starve herself, which led her to check into a treatment center for eating disorders in 2014. Kesha has been open about her struggles with body image and has since taken steps towards reinvention. However, Dr. Luke's lawyer released a statement claiming that Kesha's allegations are false and part of a press campaign to mislead the public. The lawyer also stated that Kesha had the freedom to release music but chose not to until recently.

Red squirrels in the UK have been found to carry leprosy, a disease that was eradicated in humans in Britain centuries ago. The squirrels were found to have two different species of leprosy bacterium, one of which is almost identical to a strain recovered from a medieval human skeleton. There is currently no evidence of squirrel-to-human transmission, but researchers are concerned about the health of the endangered red squirrels. The reason why squirrels, humans, and armadillos are the only known species to harbor the bacterium is still unknown. The discovery of leprosy in squirrels may help researchers understand how the disease manifests in humans and how it spreads.

It is just sad that our country is taking ten steps way way back voting in this guy."	"President Obama oversaw significant growth in federal spending to reduce inequality, but President-elect Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress are likely to undo these measures. Trump's proposed policies, such as building a border wall, deporting undocumented workers, and cutting taxes, could lead to financial panic and a possible recession. The repeal of Obamacare and the proposed tax cuts would disproportionately affect the poor, with millions potentially losing access to healthcare and the highest-income taxpayers benefiting the most. In order to balance the budget, the GOP would need to make significant spending cuts, which would likely impact assistance programs for the young and poor. Trump's vague plans make it unclear which specific policies would be eliminated, but House Speaker Paul Ryan's ""A Better Way"" plan provides some insight into potential cuts. Overall, Trump's presidency could make it much harder to be poor in America and represents a repudiation of Obama's economic policies."

The Confederate battle flag, a divisive symbol, has resurfaced in the context of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign and his supporters. The flag has been displayed at Trump rallies and used as a response to anti-Trump protests. The flag's resurgence raises questions about race relations under Trump and the influence of his campaign on white resentment and white nationalism. Historians note that the flag has had shifting meanings over time, representing white resistance to integration during the Civil Rights era and now symbolizing concerns about the displacement of white culture. While some Trump supporters argue that the flag represents heritage, others acknowledge that it has been hijacked by hate groups. Reports of discrimination and hate crimes targeting minorities have increased since the election, with many incidents invoking Trump and his campaign slogans. The flag's new context is perplexing to some Southerners who view it as a symbol of Southern sacrifice rather than a political statement.

A new study reveals that U.S. veterans have a high prevalence of sleep disorders, with sixteen percent of veterans with PTSD experiencing sleep disorders. The prevalence of sleep disorders among veterans has increased from less than one percent in 2000 to about six percent in 2010. Sleep apnea is the most common sleep disorder among veterans, followed by insomnia. Veterans with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic diseases also have higher rates of sleep disorders. The study did not establish a direct link between PTSD and sleep disorders, but a follow-up study will examine this connection.

A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals that 90% of seabirds currently eat plastic in the ocean, and by 2050, virtually all seabirds will be consuming it. The research explains that seabirds rely on their sense of smell to hunt for food, and the scent emitted by plastic in the ocean tricks them into confusing it with food. The study also found that birds that track the scent of a sulfurous compound emitted by algae, which coats floating plastic, are six times more likely to consume plastic. The research sheds light on species that are often overlooked, such as petrels and shearwaters, which are impacted by plastic ingestion. The study highlights the need to address the growing plastic pollution in oceans, which affects not only seabirds but also sea turtles, fish, and other marine animals. The problem of plastic pollution starts on land, with nonpoint source pollution being one of the biggest contributors. The top five countries that dump plastics into oceans are China, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand.

"More survivors of the Leviathan II tragedy, in which a whale-watching boat capsized and killed six people, have filed a lawsuit against the tour operator. The lawsuit describes the terrifying moments after the boat capsized, with the ship pitching and rolling in significant waves caused by a shallow reef. The captain had stopped the boat to view sea lions when a swell rose into a larger wave, causing the vessel to heel over. One of the plaintiffs, Robert Goodfellow, was submerged beneath the sea for a considerable period of time before swimming to the surface. Another plaintiff, Marya Levin, pushed a cushion towards two other passengers who were in danger of being struck by rotating propellers. Goodfellow and Levin eventually reached a lifeboat and are now seeking damages from the tour operator for physical, mental, and emotional trauma. Other survivors have also filed lawsuits, including one detailing their attempts to escape the sinking ship and a class-action suit citing post-traumatic stress disorder. The tour operator has referred to the sinking as an ""act of god."""

Scientists have been working on developing birth control for men, and a recent clinical trial showed promising results. However, the trial was discontinued due to side effects such as mood changes, depression, pain at the injection site, and increased libido. The article highlights the side effects of various birth control options for women, which are equally as bad but have not been halted. Women have always borne the burden of birth control, and the article argues that men should share in the responsibility. The availability of birth control has been revolutionary for women, leading to wage gains, increased college enrollment, and a decline in teen pregnancies. The article points out the double standard in the standards for male and female birth control, with women being expected to endure more side effects. The article concludes by highlighting the hypocrisy that women face in exchange for reproductive freedom.

Meanwhile, across the US, trees are dying at an alarming rate due to climate change, drought, disease, insects, and wildfires. California has lost 66 million trees since 2010, primarily due to drought and pine beetles. The spread of ""Sudden Oak Death"" is also infecting various plants in northern California. The presence of dead trees poses a significant fire hazard. Furthermore, a study has found that household dust exposes people to toxic chemicals, with phthalates being the most commonly found. This exposure can lead to serious health problems, especially in children."

Wells Fargo Bank has admitted to firing 5,300 low-paid workers over five years for opening fake accounts to meet sales targets. The bank has faced outrage and has stalled stock awards to two top executives. Wells Fargo CEO/Chairman John Stumpf admitted to finding nearly 80,000 phony accounts in Pennsylvania. The bank claims that it did not impose fees for most of these accounts. However, former employees have reported unethical practices, such as raiding customers' private data and forging credit card application signatures. Other banks, both community banks and big multinationals, have also engaged in similar practices. Wells Fargo has stated that it has scrapped its incentive system and will come up with a new plan next year.

The study, published in the journal Science, used climate models and historical data to predict the changes in the Mediterranean if the Paris Agreement fails. Researchers found that when global warming hits 2 degrees, deserts would expand in Spain, the Near East, and North Africa. The impact of temperature changes on lands and people's lives could also affect global security. President Barack Obama has called for the development of clean energy resources to avoid conflicts and criticized climate change skeptics. He also suggested that droughts in Syria contributed to the civil war.

His cattle have become semi-feral and roam over a large area near the Nevada, Utah, Arizona border. Bundy does not vaccinate or treat his cattle for disease, does not control breeding, and rarely brands them. The cattle are now reported to be slowly starving, although there is no official confirmation. The State of Nevada has not taken action to round up the cattle due to logistical difficulties and threats from Bundy supporters. Removing the cattle will be expensive and potentially dangerous, as they are near feral and aggressive. The value of the herd will also decline in the hot Nevada summer.

A study has found that humans have destroyed about 10 percent of Earth's wilderness since 1992, equivalent to an area half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of Alaska. The research team from Australia's University of Queensland defines wilderness as an area with no human development. The destruction is primarily due to activities such as logging, agriculture, mining, and oil and gas exploration. The study aims to raise awareness and calls for international policies to protect remaining wilderness areas. The loss of wilderness is particularly significant in South America, which has experienced a 30 percent decline. The researchers warn that once wilderness is gone, it cannot be restored, emphasizing the need to protect what is left. The report criticizes the United Nations and others for ignoring the problem and highlights the urgency of taking action to prevent further loss.

The Jewish community is overwhelmingly liberal and Democratic, leading to a sense of alienation from their fellow Americans. However, they also recognize the need for understanding and reaching out to Trump supporters. Jews are urged to reflect on their own actions and allyship with other marginalized groups. This new era has brought about a struggle for Jews to understand Trump supporters while maintaining their own values and finding solidarity with others.

This is going to cost us more money in the fire fighting department and we are going to see way worse side affects from this problem.	A new study reveals that human-induced climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires in the western United States over the past 30 years. The study shows that heightened temperatures and increased aridity since 1984 have caused fires to spread across an additional 16,000 square miles, an area larger than Massachusetts and Connecticut combined. The authors warn that further warming will exponentially increase fire activity in the coming decades. The study also highlights the role of climate change in exacerbating the recent California drought and the rise in fire incidents. Factors such as a natural climate oscillation and firefighting practices have also contributed to the increase in fires. The researchers emphasize the need to prepare for larger fire years due to climate change.

Seven leaders of an armed militia who led a 41-day stand-off at a US federal wildlife refuge in Oregon have been acquitted of conspiracy and firearms charges. The occupation of the refuge, which began in January, was a protest against federal control of land. The defendants argued that they did not intend to prevent federal officers from going to work, and the jury was unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that they had. The acquittal has been seen as a victory for states' rights and a blow to the federal government. The case against a second group of defendants is due to go to trial in February.

The police arrived to find him unconscious and bleeding, but have yet to identify a suspect or determine the motive. The incident has sparked allegations of a hate crime, given the rise in anti-Muslim sentiment during the presidential race. Alnahdi was well-liked and had quickly become part of the community. Saudi students make up a significant portion of the international student body at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. There have been reports of anti-Muslim harassment in nearby areas, but the town's administrators and police claim to be unaware of any racial tensions or prejudice.

"The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has reported that levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have surpassed an important threshold and are unlikely to dip below it for ""many generations"". The 400 parts per million benchmark was broken globally for the first time in recorded history in 2015, and 2016 is expected to be the first full year to exceed this mark. The increase in CO2 levels can be attributed to a strong El Niño event, which caused drought conditions in tropical regions, reducing the ability of vegetation to absorb CO2. Additionally, there were extra emissions from fires sparked by the drier conditions. The WMO emphasizes the need to focus on cutting CO2 emissions in order to tackle climate change and keep temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius."

Dahir Ahmed Adan, a 20-year-old Somali refugee, was identified as the suspect in the stabbing spree at a Minnesota mall. He allegedly stabbed 10 people before being shot dead by an off-duty police officer. Adan was wearing a private security uniform and asked at least one person if they were Muslim while carrying out the stabbings. Although an ISIS-affiliated media outlet claimed responsibility, there is no evidence linking Adan to the terrorist group. Adan was described as a quiet and studious young man from a well-known local Somali family. He had recently called his soccer coach for weight-loss advice and was out of work after his part-time security guard job ended. Investigators are examining Adan's media accounts and electronic devices to determine his motive. Minnesota has the largest Somali community in the US, and community leaders expressed concern about potential backlash. The Somali community in Minnesota has been targeted by ISIS for recruitment, with several individuals convicted or charged with supporting the extremist group.

The E-Rate program, which provides subsidies for schools to enhance internet connections, has received bipartisan support and billions of dollars in funding. However, a study in North Carolina found that the program had no benefits for students and actually hurt their performance. Other research has also shown little to no gains in student achievement with improved computer access. Despite this, the program has continued to receive funding and has been plagued with fraud and lax oversight. Additionally, the push for more advanced networks and expensive technology may not be necessary, as many educational resources do not require high bandwidth connections. The funding for E-Rate comes from a tax on long distance telecommunications, which disproportionately affects lower-income households. The article suggests suspending the program until its effectiveness can be objectively tested, and exploring other options for using the funds.

The text tells the story of Shelton McElroy and his two brothers, who grew up in the foster care system after their mother was sentenced to prison. Shelton and one of his brothers also ended up in prison later in life. The brothers were separated and moved between foster homes, with Shelton experiencing a troubled childhood and multiple incarcerations. Despite their struggles, the brothers managed to reconnect in prison, but their relationship was strained. Shelton's older brother, William, tried to support them but eventually gave up.

Ryan Collins, a man from Pennsylvania, has been sentenced to 18 months in jail for hacking into the accounts of celebrities and stealing nude photos and videos. He pleaded guilty to the charges and had stolen the usernames and passwords of over 600 people, including Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Scarlett Johansson, and Kirsten Dunst. Collins tricked his victims by sending emails that appeared to be from Google or Apple. Although he accessed the photos between 2012 and 2014, he was not charged with releasing them. Prosecutors have found no evidence linking Collins to the leaks or sharing the obtained information. He accessed at least 50 iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts using fraudulent email addresses.

Former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato and 64 other bankers are on trial in Madrid for an alleged credit card racket at Spain's Bankia bank. They are accused of using unofficial company credit cards for luxury purchases, totaling about €12m. The purchases were not declared to the tax authorities. Bankia was rescued in 2012 at a significant public expense, causing losses for small investors. Prosecutors are seeking jail time and fines for Rato and the former president of Caja Madrid, which merged with Bankia. Rato's successors at the IMF, Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Christine Lagarde, have also faced legal issues.

The text describes an undercover investigation into the exploitation of Syrian refugees and children in the garment industry in Turkey. The investigation reveals that many Syrian refugees, who lack work permits, are forced to work illegally in factories for low wages. The factories often hide workers during audits and continue exploiting them once the auditors leave. Some brands are aware of the abuses and are trying to address them, but others are unaware of the conditions in their supply chain. The investigation concludes that until brands have full visibility into their supply chain, the exploitation of refugees and children is likely to persist.

The war in Aleppo, Syria has had a devastating impact on the city's older residents. Many of them are facing difficult circumstances, including food and medicine shortages, as well as neglect from their families. The siege imposed by pro-government forces has made it nearly impossible to find medicine to treat chronic diseases commonly experienced by older people. Overstretched medical facilities are unable to provide proper care, leading to more deaths. Some families have even abandoned their older family members due to the extreme conditions. The situation has left many older residents feeling weak, frightened, and helpless. Despite the dangers, some refuse to leave their homes, while others are trapped and unable to leave due to the siege. The older residents of Aleppo are struggling to balance their own needs with the demands of their families, often sacrificing their own well-being. The war has taken away their dignity and left them feeling isolated and afraid.

This highlights the challenge of identifying ""lone wolf"" terrorists who are not connected to established extremist groups. The FBI retains data on individuals even after determining they are not a threat, raising concerns about privacy rights. The shooting has sparked debate about whether individuals interviewed by the FBI should be able to purchase guns or be under continued surveillance. The FBI interviewed Mateen multiple times but was unable to find any suspicious ties. The bureau is allowed to keep data on individuals even after closing investigations, which has raised concerns about privacy. Trust between local communities and the government is crucial in identifying domestic lone-wolf extremists before they commit acts of terrorism. The difficulty in identifying individuals like Mateen highlights the lack of a profile for potential terrorists."

Residents in war-ravaged eastern Aleppo received a text message warning them to evacuate within 24 hours before a planned assault. The message, likely sent by the Syrian government, also gave rebels an ultimatum to surrender or be killed. While there were no reports of bombardment by Monday afternoon, witnesses spotted fighter jets in the city. Russian warplanes have been backing the regime with airstrikes since September, causing destruction in Aleppo. The UN warned that the city is on the brink of starvation and lacks essential supplies. Turkey has been carrying out airstrikes in northern Syria to support the Free Syrian Army and plans to move on to Manbij after liberating al-Bab from ISIS. This move has stirred sectarian tensions and complicated efforts to free Syrian cities from ISIS control. Turkey considers some Kurdish militia groups as terrorists, while the US supports and arms them. The conflict between the US and Russia over which groups to target in Syria further complicates the situation.

"Mayor Samsudin Dimaukom of Datu Saudi-Ampatuan, a Muslim autonomous area of Mindanao in the Philippines, was killed in a shootout with local authorities. He was on President Rodrigo Duterte's list of ""narco-politicians"" with alleged ties to the illegal drug world. Dimaukom and his wife had previously surrendered to the police to deny involvement. During a highway roadblock, an armed encounter occurred between Dimaukom's men and the police, resulting in the deaths of 10 men. Duterte's administration has been conducting a violent war on drugs, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of drug suspects by the police and vigilantes. Critics argue that the police are acting with impunity. Dimaukom is not the first elected official implicated in the drug war. The Senate Committee in the Philippines, led by a Duterte ally, decided to stop investigating extrajudicial killings of drug dealers and users."

I guess the number of women working in senior positions is shrinking. There is also a decline of women in the labor force. But there is evidence that the education gender gap is shrinking, so there are more women educated. It just seems that more women are choosing not to work.	The World Economic Forum (WEF) released its annual global gender gap report, revealing that the US has slipped to 45th place in terms of gender equality. This decline is attributed to a decrease in women's participation in the labor force and a shrinking number of women in senior positions. However, the US has closed its education gender gap. Globally, progress towards economic equality has slowed, with the gender pay gap persisting and women's labor force participation lower than men's. The report warns that the global economic gender gap is not expected to close until 2196. The lack of progress in economic equality is concerning, as jobs typically held by women are at risk due to technological disruption. The top-ranking countries in terms of gender equality are predominantly Scandinavian. The Global Gender Gap Index ranks countries based on the distribution of resources between men and women.

Trump and Pence have expressed intentions to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which covers birth control. In response, some women are considering getting an intrauterine device (IUD) as a long-lasting form of birth control that could outlast any changes made by the administration. IUDs are highly effective and safe, with some versions lasting up to 12 years. Women are advised to take action soon, as an IUD can cost up to $1,000 without insurance coverage. Planned Parenthood offers a guide for those interested in learning more about IUDs. The fate of the Affordable Care Act and its birth control provisions is uncertain after President Obama leaves office on January 20, 2017.

Shawn Gill experienced a case of stolen and mistaken identity when someone used his name after a car accident. The actual driver was David Joseph Singer, who had a criminal record. Gill reported the identity theft and filed the necessary paperwork, but his license was still suspended and he lost his job as a driver for Lyft and Uber. Gill appealed the decision but faced difficulties in court due to incorrect police paperwork and testimony. Gill's friend sought help from a journalist to uncover the truth. It is unclear how Singer obtained Gill's ID information, and there are questions about why the incorrect information was not corrected. Gill's lawyer advised him not to talk to the police, but a letter from the officer who made the report could potentially clear Gill's record. The article calls for Commissioner Richard Ross to intervene and resolve the situation.

A grieving father, Shayne Goodchild, spoke publicly for the first time since the Dreamworld theme park accident in Australia that killed three of his family members. Goodchild confirmed that his daughter Kate's death was witnessed by her husband and their 8-month-old daughter. He also mentioned that his 12-year-old granddaughter saw her mother's life being taken. The accident occurred when a malfunction on the Thunder River Rapids Ride caused a flume carrying six people to flip over. Goodchild expressed gratitude for the support they have received and offered condolences to the family of the fourth victim. Private funerals will be held for the victims, and the park will remain closed until after the funerals. Goodchild expressed a desire to know what went wrong and why their loved ones were taken from them.

The country had a couple bad years because of drought and then flooding, and suddenly everyone was starving.	North Korea has experienced heavy flooding caused by Typhoon Lionrock, leading to an unusual appeal for help from the government. The flooding has caused significant destruction to homes, infrastructure, and power systems in the country's Northeastern Hamgyong province. At least 133 people have been killed and nearly 400 are missing. The government has redirected its loyalty campaign to assist those affected. This public admission of needing help is rare for North Korea. The international community is being called upon to respond to the disaster. This comes after North Korea's fifth nuclear test, which was met with international condemnation.

However, no damage was reported at the oil terminal, which is one of the world's largest. This was the third earthquake in Oklahoma this year with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater. No major injuries were reported, but there were cracks, fallen bricks, and facades damaged. The earthquake was centered 1 mile west of Cushing and occurred near a previous magnitude 4.3 quake. Aftershocks were feared, and parts of the city were cordoned off. An assisted living community was evacuated, and the Cushing Public School District canceled classes. Highways and bridges within a 15-mile radius of the epicenter were undamaged. The quake was felt as far away as Iowa, Illinois, and Texas. Cushing is known as the ""Pipeline Crossroads of the World"" and has a large oil storage terminal. Two pipeline companies reported no trouble, but not all companies had been heard from."

Society is unfair in a lot of ways, and this is one of the few ways where women benefit over men.	Male models are being paid up to 75% less than women, according to a top modelling agent. Elizabeth Rose, who manages male models at Premier, believes it is unfair and not a form of female empowerment. She explains that women can be paid up to £40,000 for a top show, while male models only receive £10,000 on average. However, she notes that the situation is slowly changing as advertisers are increasingly using male models for grooming products. Elizabeth also highlights that the top 10 female models all make millions, whereas only the top three male models earn over a million. She tries to negotiate higher fees for male models but acknowledges that women face more discrimination due to their age. Elizabeth believes that change can happen if more agents and models refuse to accept unequal pay.

Dear friend,  I have just finished reading a very interesting and somewhat disturbing article. It was about Thomas Arthur, an inmate on death row in Alabama. There began a massive legal battle between the courts, justices, and lawyers about the legality and morality of lethal injection practices. I feel conflicted because on one hand, these people committed unthinkable crimes and deserve severe punishment, but on the other hand, taking a life may still not be justifiable.	The Supreme Court has halted the execution of an Alabama death row inmate, Thomas D. Arthur, for the seventh time. The execution was scheduled for Thursday evening but was stayed as officials waited for the Supreme Court to consider his appeals. Justice Clarence Thomas issued an order halting the execution until further notice. The court later granted Arthur's stay request, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voting in favor as a courtesy to his colleagues. The stay will remain in place until the justices decide whether to consider the case. Arthur was sentenced to death for the 1982 killing of Troy Wicker, the husband of a woman with whom Arthur had an affair. His attorneys argued against Alabama's lethal injection protocol and suggested execution by firing squad instead. The state's Department of Corrections is only allowed to carry out executions by injection and electrocution. Alabama's death penalty system has faced increased scrutiny following a Supreme Court ruling that struck down Florida's death penalty system.

They state that humans are causing climate change, with evidence of rising seas, warming oceans and atmosphere, melting ice, changing rainfall patterns, and increasing acidity in the ocean. The scientists criticize politicians and real estate developers without scientific experience who deny climate change. They express sadness that the Republican Party, historically supportive of environmental initiatives, is now rejecting climate science. The scientists emphasize the economic and social costs of inaction and call for rational decision-making to manage climate change risks. They also criticize the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, for wanting to scrap environmental agreements. The scientists highlight the success of renewable energy sources in reducing emissions and argue that action to reduce pollution does not harm the economy.

"Environmental health officers are calling for a smoking ban in playgrounds, zoos, and other areas where children play. The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health wants local councils to designate these areas as smoking exclusion zones to reduce the chances of children thinking that smoking is normal. The ban would also protect children from secondhand smoke. A recent poll showed that 89% of adults surveyed support a ban on smoking in children's play areas. Some councils have already implemented voluntary bans in certain outdoor places. Forest, a smokers' rights group, criticized the proposal, calling it ""Orwellian."" The smoking ban in enclosed public places has been in effect in the UK since 2007."

According to FBI data, murders in the US increased by 10.8% in 2015, the largest single-year percentage jump since 1971. The rise in violence was driven by an increase in the murders of black men and an increase in gun murders. The number of firearm murders increased by roughly 1,500, while knife murders dropped slightly. The percentage of murders committed with guns increased to 71.5%. Despite the increase in murders, overall crime rates did not increase substantially. The attorney general mentioned the overall increase in violent crime but did not mention the increase in murders. A third of the murder increase was driven by ten larger cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Black men and women face less violence today than in the early 1990s. In a separate incident, two New Jersey Transit buses crashed in the Lincoln Tunnel, injuring as many as 44 people.

It is often religiously motivated and can include methods such as talk therapy, electroshock therapy, and aversion therapy. A survivor of conversion therapy, TC, shared his experience of being subjected to these practices, including harassment and physical abuse. Conversion therapy has been linked to serious harm, including increased rates of suicide and mental health issues among LGBTQ individuals. While mainstream psychiatric organizations do not support conversion therapy, it is still promoted in some circles. Only five states and the District of Columbia have laws protecting LGBTQ youth from being forced into conversion therapy. TC, who escaped conversion therapy, emphasizes the need to recognize the harm caused by these practices and to treat LGBTQ individuals with dignity and respect.

They state that humans are causing climate change, with evidence of rising seas, warming oceans and atmosphere, melting ice, changing rainfall patterns, and increasing acidity in the ocean. The scientists criticize politicians and real estate developers without scientific experience who deny climate change.

The scientists emphasize the economic and social costs of inaction and call for rational decision-making to manage climate change risks. They also criticize the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, for wanting to scrap environmental agreements. The scientists highlight the success of renewable energy sources in reducing emissions and argue that action to reduce pollution does not harm the economy. They warn that voting for anti-science politicians will contribute to the climate change problem and urge voters to consider the conversation they will have with their children about their choices.

A tugboat crash in British Columbia's coastal waters caused a diesel fuel leak, endangering wildlife and prompting efforts to recover the affected species. Divers found endangered abalone and juvenile herring in the fuel spill area. The outer boom meant to contain the oil broke free, spreading the oil further. Salvage crews have recovered 40% of the estimated 200,000 liters of fuel. The marine life in the Gale Passage, including a crucial herring spawning area, is at risk. The local clam fishery has been shut down, and the spill response has been criticized. Diesel is highly toxic to marine creatures. Additional protection measures are being considered.

The frog, featured in the Photo Ark project, served as a symbol of the extinction crisis. Toughie's species was only described in 2008, three years after he was found during a frog rescue mission. The deadly chytrid fungus wiped out up to 85% of amphibians in Toughie's habitat. Photographer Joel Sartore, who photographed Toughie for the Photo Ark project, emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about extinction. He believes that people need to meet and fall in love with these animals to care about their preservation. The loss of species threatens healthy ecosystems and ultimately our own survival. Sartore warns that if we continue on this path, we could lose half of all species by the end of the century.

Eye injuries in youth sports are common and often involve activities that are not typically considered risky for eyes, according to a study of emergency room visits related to eye problems among athletes. The study found that about 30,000 sports-related eye injuries were treated each year at participating emergency rooms, with a majority occurring in people younger than 18. Basketball was the sport most likely to result in eye injuries, followed by baseball, softball, air guns, cycling, and soccer. While most injuries were minor, some required surgery and threatened athletes' vision. The study suggests that protective eyewear, such as wraparound glasses, could help prevent these injuries.

Two earthquakes hit central Italy, causing further damage to buildings already weakened by the August quake. Although there were no reports of serious injuries or deaths, the aftershocks revealed structural weaknesses in the area and added to the psychological stress of the residents. The government has allocated 40 million euros for housing those displaced by the quakes and promised to begin reconstruction soon.

The historic bell tower in Camerino collapsed, but the mayor stated that previous reconstruction work had contributed to the absence of serious injuries. With winter approaching, officials are considering alternative solutions to tents for housing the affected population, particularly the elderly.

Management and ownership at a Saskatoon dog kennel were warned about multiple serious problems with their animal care methods before the death of 14 large breed dogs. The kennel was warned about ventilation problems, among other issues, by a certified master trainer and kennel care expert. The SPCA also received a copy of the complaints but is unable to pursue them due to lack of power. The dogs died of heat exhaustion after a malfunction in the building's heating system caused the room they were in to become excessively hot. The kennel manager expressed remorse and stated that the upper-floor room where the deaths occurred has been closed off. The kennel will remain open. The kennel had previously received positive reviews from customers, but the trainer who raised concerns said that customers don't see the full picture. The trainer quit after management refused his suggestions and took his list of concerns to the SPCA.

Prosecutors have found no evidence linking Collins to the leaks or sharing the obtained information. He accessed at least 50 iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts using fraudulent email addresses. Collins was originally charged in Los Angeles but was sentenced in Pennsylvania, his home state.

I was completely different before and after middle school, and during those three years themselves it was like I was someone I'd never met. God bless the mothers who stick with us throughout it all.	A new study by Arizona State University researchers found that middle school is the most stressful time for mothers. The study involved analyzing surveys from over 2,200 well-educated moms across the country, and mothers of only middle-school-age children reported the highest levels of stress, loneliness, and emptiness. Middle school is a challenging time for children, with raging hormones, changing bodies and brains, exposure to peer pressure and risky behaviors, and a desire for independence while still feeling dependent on parents. Parents often struggle to navigate these changes and may not realize that their children still want a relationship with them. It is important for parents to listen, be supportive, and not give up during this time. Developing a strong relationship during middle school can carry into the teen years and young adulthood. Mothers should also reach out to other moms for support during this challenging time.

Certainly it's no secret that animal agriculture is terrible for the planet. Hopefully this will be the next piece in a long line of information pushing us towards vegetarianism.	Scientists have found that the method used by the U.S. poultry industry to stun chickens before slaughter does not consistently render them unconscious. This means that a significant number of chickens likely experience intense suffering when they are killed. The lack of regulations governing the humane slaughter of chickens in the U.S. has allowed poultry companies to prioritize meat quality over ensuring that chickens are reliably stunned. Animal protection groups are pressuring companies to phase out the use of electric water-baths and adopt alternative methods, such as controlled atmosphere killing. Gas stunning systems are considered more humane and produce better meat quality. The current process of slaughtering chickens also causes them stress and pain, with many experiencing broken bones and wing damage. The U.S. Agriculture Department estimates that hundreds of thousands of birds are unintentionally boiled alive each year. Animal welfare groups are campaigning to improve conditions for broiler chickens and some companies, like Perdue Farms, have pledged to install gas stunning systems in their facilities.

Of course it would be great to ensure good keeping of animals, but there are more pressing tragedies happening much more often to human beings that we should focus on before addressing these issues of occasional animal mis-handling.	The world's wildlife trade policy body, CITES, is calling for better treatment and tracking of illegally traded animals that are confiscated by authorities. Between 2010 and 2014, over 60,000 wild creatures were seized, with a fifth of them being threatened species. However, wildlife advocates argue that animals often suffer after being confiscated, as they are sometimes sent to inadequate facilities, returned to traffickers, or released back into the wild where they can spread diseases. CITES guidelines state that confiscated animals should be sent back to the exporting country, a designated rescue center, or other appropriate places, with humane treatment ensured. However, this doesn't always happen due to cost, impracticality, or lack of designated rescue centers. CITES member countries have agreed to distribute a questionnaire to gather information on how nations deal with confiscated animals, and Humane Society International has offered recommendations on setting up rescue centers.

Two divers, Patrick Peacock and Chris Rittenmeyer, were found dead in the Eagle's Nest cave dive area in Western Florida. They had gone diving with a third man who reported them missing. The bodies were found the next day in a dangerous area of the cave system. The cave is known for its allure and is a popular destination for experienced divers. However, it is also considered dangerous, and signs warn divers of the risks. The area had been off-limits for divers from 1999 to 2003. Only highly trained divers should attempt to dive there, as even skilled divers can be affected at dangerous depths. The cause of death has not been disclosed, and autopsy results are pending. Some people have called for the area to be closed again, while others argue that people should be allowed to dive there if they have the necessary training and experience. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission did not comment on whether the site might be closed.

Those poachers deserve to die; they are horrible people and they are destroying a unique species. This is a terrible thing. They desperately need to protect these poor rhinoes from people.	"In South Africa, private security companies are training anti-poaching guards to protect rhinos from poachers. The demand for rhino horns, which are used in traditional medicine and high-end ornaments, has led to a spike in poaching. The South African government has declared rhino poaching a ""national priority crime"" and has implemented initiatives to combat the problem. Private rhino owners have spent millions of dollars on security measures, but the fight against poaching remains challenging. The security industry plays a crucial role in protecting rhinos on private game reserves, but there are concerns about the escalating conflict and the potential for violence. Some believe that more focus should be placed on education and awareness to address the root causes of poaching."

It affects all life on earth, not just people. Biodiversity has been affected and has gone down. Temperatures are changing for the worse. It's simply awful.	Climate change has had a broad impact on ecosystems, with evidence of its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. A study identified 94 core ecological processes, of which 82% showed evidence of impact from climate change. These impacts range from shifts in species ranges and changes in phenology to disruptions at the genetic and ecosystem levels. Species are adapting to temperature extremes, with changes in physiology and morphology. Changes in phenology, abundance, and distribution of species have also been observed. These impacts have implications for food security, as reduced genetic diversity, inconsistent crop yields, and decreased productivity in fisheries threaten resources. Changes in disease vectors and the emergence of novel pathogens and pests pose a direct threat to human health and resources. Understanding these impacts is crucial for adapting to and mitigating the influence of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Wind turbines are not only killing local birds, but also birds from hundreds of miles away, according to researchers from Purdue University and the U.S. Geological Survey. Using DNA and stable isotopes, the researchers found that golden eagles killed at a wind farm in California can come from far distances. This raises concerns about the impact of wind farms on bird populations. The Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) in California, one of the oldest and largest wind farms in the world, has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of birds. The researchers found that eagles are attracted to the area due to the abundance of prey and the windy conditions, but fail to see the turbine blades and get hit. The study also revealed that a large percentage of the birds killed are from neighboring states, highlighting the need for environmental assessments to consider the impact on the entire population. The findings have implications for the management of wind energy facilities and the conservation of bird species.

Justice Clarence Thomas issued an order halting the execution until further notice. The court later granted Arthur's stay request, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voting in favor as a courtesy to his colleagues. The stay will remain in place until the justices decide whether to consider the case. Arthur was sentenced to death for the 1982 killing of Troy Wicker, the husband of a woman with whom Arthur had an affair. His attorneys argued against Alabama's lethal injection protocol and suggested execution by firing squad instead. The state's Department of Corrections is only allowed to carry out executions by injection and electrocution.

Trump's deficits in national and swing state polls are unprecedented, and his ground game is weak compared to Clinton's. Early voting numbers in Arizona and the shrinking advantage of Republicans in Florida and North Carolina indicate a potential win for Clinton. However, Democrats are not taking the outcome for granted and are working hard to mobilize voters. Trump's refusal to accept the voting results and his controversial remarks have galvanized Clinton's supporters.

Afghanistan is facing a looming humanitarian crisis as the number of displaced people continues to rise. Over a million people were already uprooted last year, and this year, at least another million Afghans are on the move within the country and across its borders. The violence and conflict in Afghanistan have forced many to flee, while others are escaping poverty and drought. The United Nations and other aid agencies are struggling to provide emergency assistance, and if they fail, it will become a full-blown crisis. The country has been plagued by massive displacement since the Soviet invasion in 1979, and the current violence is some of the worst since the Taliban was toppled. The clashes between Afghan and Taliban forces have pushed even more people from their homes. The government is unable to reach all affected areas, and the Taliban now controls more territory than at any time since 2001. The return of refugees to areas controlled by insurgents is a concern, as it could exacerbate insecurity and joblessness. The displaced are often rejected and forced into squalid camps, with limited access to clean water and food. The situation is dire, and the government is incapable of creating jobs or improving the economy in remote areas. Criminal and terrorist networks may exploit the jobless and displaced youths, further deepening the crisis.

Dahir Ahmed Adan, a 20-year-old Somali refugee, was identified as the suspect in the stabbing spree at a Minnesota mall. He allegedly stabbed 10 people before being shot dead by an off-duty police officer. Adan was wearing a private security uniform and asked at least one person if they were Muslim while carrying out the stabbings. Although an ISIS-affiliated media outlet claimed responsibility, there is no evidence linking Adan to the terrorist group. Adan was described as a quiet and studious young man from a well-known local Somali family. He had recently called his soccer coach for weight-loss advice and was out of work after his part-time security guard job ended. Investigators are examining Adan's media accounts and electronic devices to determine his motive. Minnesota has the largest Somali community in the US, and community leaders expressed concern about potential backlash. The Somali community in Minnesota has been targeted by ISIS for recruitment, with several individuals convicted or charged with supporting the extremist group.

It is bad for the government of Louisiana, but you can't blame these people for getting out. And, of course, there is nothing that they can do to stop them.	The flood-ravaged state of Louisiana may face a population loss as residents consider leaving after the flood waters recede. While few people have confirmed their departure, it is a topic of discussion among many. The state's economy will suffer if there is a decline in population, as it will reduce spending and tax revenue. Louisiana experienced a 6% population decrease after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, taking over five years to recover. Although this year's exodus is unlikely to be as severe, the shortage of available housing and the closure of small businesses due to the flooding pose challenges. Additionally, the decline in oil industry jobs and the state's high unemployment rate further complicate the situation. The aid and insurance money that typically accompanies natural disasters may not be enough to prevent people from leaving, exacerbating an already struggling economy.

A suspected serial killer in Anchorage, Alaska was stopped by a police officer who was responding to a theft complaint. The officer, Arn Salao, was shot multiple times by the suspect, James Dale Ritchie, but managed to return fire and fight off his assailant. Another officer arrived at the scene and also fired at Ritchie, killing him. Ballistics tests revealed that the gun Ritchie used was the same one used in five other homicides in Anchorage in 2016. Ritchie had prior arrests for drugs and burglary and had recently returned to Alaska from West Virginia. Two of the victims linked to Ritchie's gun were identified as Jason Netter Sr. and Brianna Foisy, who were found dead in July. Another two victims, Bryant De Husson and Kevin Schuyler Turner, were found dead in August. The motive behind the killings is unknown, and it is unclear if Ritchie knew any of the victims. The police believe that the chance encounter between Officer Salao and Ritchie may have saved countless lives. Two other unsolved double homicides in Anchorage have not been linked to Ritchie.

The death toll in the Mediterranean Sea has reached a new record number, with over 4,600 people dead or missing this year. The central Mediterranean route, mainly departing from Libya, has seen the highest number of deaths. The issue is not the lack of resources in rescue operations, but the instability and violence in Libya, where human traffickers exploit people's hopes for a better life. The Libyan Civil War worsened the situation, leaving vulnerable migrants in a dangerous position. Traffickers are increasingly unconcerned with safety, forcing migrants to make the journey in rough seas without proper equipment. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) advocates for long-term policies that provide information about the dangers of the journey and safe passages for migrants. The IOM is also fighting against a negative narrative on migration, highlighting its historical positive impact.

Maybe if they had a different CEO, they would have been able to survive.	American Apparel has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time after its latest turnaround plan failed. Canadian clothing manufacturer Gildan Activewear has agreed to acquire intellectual property assets and inventory from American Apparel for $66 million. The company's stores will remain open while it pursues a sale of its operations, but liquidation is a serious risk. American Apparel's chief restructuring officer stated that the company's turnaround strategy completely failed, with a 33% decline in year-over-year sales. The company has faced financial troubles for years, including the firing of its CEO in 2014 and strategic missteps. American Apparel currently has 110 stores and listed about $215 million in debts.

Hello friend,  It's sad that thousands of hectares of tropical forests in Latin America have been changed from their natural habitat to grow bananas. The rise of different types of diseases that focus on banana tress is alarming. I hope we can find a cure for these diseases before it's too late.  I did not realize bananas were a genetic accident. Lucky for us!	The Cavendish banana, which is the most widely sold banana in the Western world, is facing the threat of extinction due to its vulnerability to diseases. The previous popular variety, Gros Michel, was wiped out by a fungal disease called Fusarium wilt. The Cavendish replaced it but is now susceptible to a disease called Black Sigatoka. Additionally, a new strain of Fusarium wilt called Tropical Race 4 (TR4) is spreading and could devastate the banana industry. To combat these diseases, scientists are studying the genetics of wild banana varieties and banana pathogens to find resistant genes. However, there has been little effort and funding for this research. By increasing genetic diversity in cultivated bananas, the industry can reduce its vulnerability to diseases. Scientists have already identified the genome sequences of bananas and the fungi causing the diseases, which provides a basis for identifying disease-resistant genes. With the use of genetic engineering and plant breeding, these genes can be transferred into desired cultivars. It is crucial to increase the pool of genetic diversity in cultivated bananas to avoid repeating the history of the Gros Michel and Cavendish varieties.

I know that's impossible to eradicate it, but it schools and parents take the issue seriously enough, we could at least reduce the number of suicides.	According to new government data, the rate of suicide deaths among children aged 10 to 14 has doubled since 2007. However, deaths from motor vehicle traffic and homicide have decreased over the same time period. Younger children may attempt suicide impulsively due to bad relationships with family and friends, while older children may do so because of relationship issues. Warning signs for suicide in children include increased sadness, irritability, anger, loss of interest in friends or activities, and saying mean or derogatory things. It is important for parents to talk to their children and listen to their feelings. There is limited research on suicide in children, and experts hope that the report will raise awareness and lead to more prevention efforts.

According to former Wells Fargo workers, the practice of opening unauthorized accounts to meet sales goals has been happening for much longer than the bank has admitted. The scandal, which involved the opening of as many as two million fake accounts since 2011, has led to the firing of 5,300 employees and an investigation by the Justice Department. One former branch manager, Susan Fischer, recalls being instructed to have her employees open unauthorized accounts in 2007. When she refused, she faced pressure and eventually had to take a medical leave of absence. Fischer is now speaking out to prevent this behavior from continuing.

Wells Fargo Bank has admitted to firing 5,300 low-paid workers over five years for opening fake accounts to meet sales targets. The bank has faced outrage and has stalled stock awards to two top executives. Wells Fargo CEO/Chairman John Stumpf admitted to finding nearly 80,000 phony accounts in Pennsylvania. The bank claims that it did not impose fees for most of these accounts. However, former employees have reported unethical practices, such as raiding customers' private data and forging credit card application signatures. Other banks, both community banks and big multinationals, have also engaged in similar practices. Wells Fargo has stated that it has scrapped its incentive system and will come up with a new plan next year.

While the population had been increasing in recent years, with 2,226 tigers in 2015 compared to 1,411 in 2005, this year has seen a significant increase in tiger deaths. 78 tigers have already died in the first 10 months of the year, surpassing the number of deaths in the same period over the past six years. The cause of some deaths is still being determined, but others have been attributed to human activities such as poaching, poisoning, electrocution, and road accidents. India has seized the largest number of tigers and tiger products, with 540 seizures between 2000 and 2015. The increase in tiger mortalities and seizures is a cause for concern, and experts emphasize the need for coordinated enforcement operations to combat illegal wildlife trade, which they describe as a transnational organized crime.

"Sally Brampton, the founding editor of Elle magazine in the UK, took her own life after health professionals failed to offer her help, according to an inquest. Brampton, who had a long battle with depression, drowned after walking into the sea near her home. She had sought help from a psychiatrist and GP but did not receive the assistance she needed. Two months prior to her death, she had been referred to mental health services but was not offered any help. The inquest revealed that crucial information about her condition had not been provided to the relevant services. The coroner concluded that there were missed opportunities to help Brampton, but it is uncertain if they would have changed the outcome. The mental health services have since made changes and no longer use faxes. Brampton was a respected journalist and author, known for her book ""Shoot the Damn Dog"" about her battle with depression."

Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, is facing a tough re-election fight after years of comfortable victories. His decision to embrace Donald Trump has worsened his chances of winning. His opponent, Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel, has received significant financial support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Issa has tried to fight back by highlighting accusations made against Applegate by his former wife. In another California district, Representative Jeff Denham is also facing a tough re-election fight. Denham, like Issa, has expressed support for Trump. Both districts have a large and growing Latino population, which is expected to vote against Trump. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC have invested over $4 million to defeat Issa and Denham. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, has given over $1.6 million to Denham. Denham's refusal to disavow Trump has put him at odds with the editorial board of The Modesto Bee, the largest newspaper in his district, which has endorsed his opponent, Michael Eggman.

"The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, was known to the FBI for years but was not considered a security threat. This highlights the challenge of identifying ""lone wolf"" terrorists who are not connected to established extremist groups. The FBI retains data on individuals even after determining they are not a threat, raising concerns about privacy rights. The shooting has sparked debate about whether individuals interviewed by the FBI should be able to purchase guns or be under continued surveillance. The FBI interviewed Mateen multiple times but was unable to find any suspicious ties. The bureau is allowed to keep data on individuals even after closing investigations, which has raised concerns about privacy. Trust between local communities and the government is crucial in identifying domestic lone-wolf extremists before they commit acts of terrorism. The difficulty in identifying individuals like Mateen highlights the lack of a profile for potential terrorists."

The large Somali community in Minneapolis went through a rigorous screening process to enter the US, but younger generations are struggling to earn a living. Donald Trump's anti-immigrant stance is based on a false notion that the country's safety is at risk from Muslim extremists due to lax vetting policies. In reality, refugees face a lengthy screening process by the United Nations before coming to the US. However, once in the country, they receive limited support in terms of job-search help and cash assistance, making it difficult for them to integrate into the American economy. This lack of support contributes to refugee families' difficulty in escaping poverty and younger generations' sense of isolation.

He had a semi-automatic handgun, a semi-automatic rifle, a knife, and 2,600 rounds of live ammunition, all legally purchased. Six victims were taken to the hospital, and three were treated at the scene. The motive for the attack is believed to be the suspect's troubled relationship with his law firm.

A man is suing Royal Caribbean after his husband fell overboard during a Caribbean cruise and died. The lawsuit claims that the cruise line failed to make a timely attempt to save him or recover his body. The husband alleges that they were subjected to homophobic taunts and slurs from crewmembers before the incident. The argument escalated, and the husband fell off the stateroom balcony, landing on a lifeboat before falling into the ocean.

Scientists have found that the method used by the U.S. poultry industry to stun chickens before slaughter does not consistently render them unconscious. This means that a significant number of chickens likely experience intense suffering when they are killed. The lack of regulations governing the humane slaughter of chickens in the U.S. has allowed poultry companies to prioritize meat quality over ensuring that chickens are reliably stunned. Animal protection groups are pressuring companies to phase out the use of electric water-baths and adopt alternative methods, such as controlled atmosphere killing. Gas stunning systems are considered more humane and produce better meat quality. The current process of slaughtering chickens also causes them stress and pain, with many experiencing broken bones and wing damage. The U.S. Agriculture Department estimates that hundreds of thousands of birds are unintentionally boiled alive each year. Animal welfare groups are campaigning to improve conditions for broiler chickens and some companies, like Perdue Farms, have pledged to install gas stunning systems in their facilities.

Conversion therapy is a set of practices aimed at changing a person's sexuality or gender identity to fit heterosexual or cisgender norms. It is often religiously motivated and can include methods such as talk therapy, electroshock therapy, and aversion therapy. A survivor of conversion therapy, TC, shared his experience of being subjected to these practices, including harassment and physical abuse. Conversion therapy has been linked to serious harm, including increased rates of suicide and mental health issues among LGBTQ individuals. While mainstream psychiatric organizations do not support conversion therapy, it is still promoted in some circles. Only five states and the District of Columbia have laws protecting LGBTQ youth from being forced into conversion therapy. TC, who escaped conversion therapy, emphasizes the need to recognize the harm caused by these practices and to treat LGBTQ individuals with dignity and respect.

ISIS has executed 232 people near Mosul and taken tens of thousands as human shields against advancing Iraqi forces, according to the United Nations. The terror group carried out mass killings as punishment for defying its orders. Since October 17, ISIS has taken tens of thousands of men, women, and children from the outskirts of Mosul into the city, intending to use them as human shields. Iraqi forces have launched an operation to cut ISIS supply lines west of Mosul. Reports indicate that ISIS has abducted thousands of families from various areas. The use of human shields is a violation of international humanitarian law. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned ISIS's strategy and urged those fighting ISIS not to carry out revenge attacks. The Mosul operation has already displaced thousands of people, and camps have been set up to accommodate them. Civilians continue to flee despite the risks involved.

I can't even imagine such bad living conditions. These kids deserve a better life. Not fear and illness.	The number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen has risen to 1,410 within three weeks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The outbreak was declared on October 6, and by October 10, there were 24 suspected cases. However, as of Thursday, there were 1,410 suspected cases in 10 out of Yemen's 23 governorates. The conflict between a Saudi Arabia-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi group has destroyed much of Yemen's infrastructure, making it difficult to control the disease outbreak. Cholera is just one of the risks in Yemen's war, which has left millions displaced and in need of medical help. Only 47 of the suspected cases have tested positive for cholera, and the outbreak has spread beyond the capital to nine other governorates. Children under 10 account for half of the cases, with six deaths from cholera and 36 associated deaths from acute watery diarrhea. Prompt treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics is crucial in severe cases.

Millions of trees across the United States are dying due to a combination of factors including disease, insects, drought, and wildfires, all exacerbated by climate change. One example is the rapid ohi'a death disease in Hawaii, which has infected nearly 50,000 acres of native forest. The cause of this disease is still unknown, and scientists are struggling to find a treatment. In California, an invasive pathogen called Sudden Oak Death is killing millions of trees, including redwoods. Bark beetles and mountain pine beetles are also wreaking havoc on forests, expanding their range due to climate change. The loss of trees has far-reaching consequences, affecting clean water, carbon storage, and entire ecosystems. Scientists are working on genetic research to understand why some trees are able to survive these threats, but they warn that in a few decades, American forests may be unrecognizable.

The US military has admitted that civilians were likely killed in a joint Afghan-US operation in Kunduz, Afghanistan. The operation targeted Taliban leaders planning attacks in the city. Alongside the 30 civilians, two US service members were also killed. The US military expressed regret for the loss of innocent lives and promised to investigate the incident. Afghan forces, with US military advice, conducted the operation and encountered significant enemy fire. In addition to the civilian casualties, four members of Afghan special forces were killed, and 26 insurgents were killed. The Pentagon identified the dead US service members and expressed condolences. The incident occurred on the same day as a Taliban mortar attack that killed seven people attending a wedding party. In April, the Pentagon announced disciplinary action for a fatal US strike on a Kunduz hospital in 2015. The strike was deemed unintentional human error and equipment failure, rather than a war crime.

Two American sisters, Robin Korkki and Anne Korkki, were found unresponsive in their resort in the Seychelles and later pronounced dead. Autopsies revealed that they died from acute pulmonary edema, or excess fluid in the lungs, with Anne also having excess fluid in the brain. The cause of the fluid buildup is still unknown, and toxicology analysis is being conducted. No visible injuries were found on the bodies. The sisters' family is seeking answers and some members have traveled to the Seychelles to gather details and bring the bodies home. The Seychelles is a popular tourist destination known for its beaches and coral reefs. The sisters arrived on September 15 and were scheduled to leave on September 24.

The text discusses how Donald Trump was able to give a voice to the pain and anger of millions of Americans who felt ignored and dismissed by the political elite. These individuals had been poorly educated and lacked the words to express their feelings and experiences. Trump appealed to their fears and frustrations, promising to restore their world and make America great again. The text also highlights the long-standing anger and despair that has been building for decades due to job loss and economic changes. The media and policymakers often use clinical terms to describe the struggles faced by these workers, while corporations prioritize profits over human decency. Trump's supporters accepted his controversial actions because they felt he understood their perspective.

Government can only do so much and it makes little sense for me to worry about another person's health when they are consciously making the decision to kill themselves.	A new study reveals that 28.6% of cancer deaths in the United States are caused by smoking. The research considered 12 smoking-related cancers and found that smoking is involved in 22.9% of cancer deaths in women and 33.7% in men. In 2014, an estimated 167,133 people died from smoking-related cancers. However, this number does not include deaths from other smoking-related diseases. The study also highlights geographic variations, with higher percentages of smoking-related cancer deaths in certain states. Tobacco control efforts have been credited with preventing eight million premature deaths, but many parts of the country still have weak tobacco control policies. The analysis only focused on cigarettes, excluding other smoking methods and secondhand smoke. The data relies on self-reports, which may underestimate smoking prevalence. The tobacco industry still holds influence, particularly in Southern states where most tobacco is grown.

"France's President Francois Hollande has announced plans to completely shut down the migrant camp known as ""the Jungle"" in Calais. He has called on London to help deal with the thousands of people living in squalor in the camp, whose ultimate goal is to reach Britain. France intends to relocate the migrants in small groups around the country, but right-wing opponents accuse Hollande of mismanaging a problem that they believe is Britain's responsibility. Hollande reminded Britain that if France stopped preventing migrants from entering Britain, it would be obliged to deal with the matter when asylum-seekers arrive on its shores. He expects London to honor agreements on managing the flow of migrants."

Former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato and 64 other bankers are on trial in Madrid for an alleged credit card racket at Spain's Bankia bank. They are accused of using unofficial company credit cards for luxury purchases, totaling about €12m. The purchases were not declared to the tax authorities. Bankia was rescued in 2012 at a significant public expense, causing losses for small investors. Prosecutors are seeking jail time and fines for Rato and the former president of Caja Madrid, which merged with Bankia. Rato's successors at the IMF, Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Christine Lagarde, have also faced legal issues.

Nosey, a 34-year-old female African elephant, has been held captive and subjected to decades of abuse. She has been forced to live in solitary confinement, perform in circuses, and give rides to people. This has caused significant stress to her physical and psychological well-being. Nosey has spent most of her life in a small trailer, receiving little exercise and no socialization. She has developed arthritis due to her long-term confinement. Despite over 200 citations and 30 violations of the Animal Welfare Act by her owner, Hugo Tommy Liebel, the USDA has not taken action. Nosey is suffering from chronic, untreated health problems and lives in pain. The USDA has the power and responsibility to respond to citizen complaints and confiscate Nosey, releasing her into a proper elephant sanctuary.

A recent study has found that rates of toddlers and preschoolers being hospitalized for opioid overdoses have more than doubled in recent years. The study analyzed data from over 13,000 records of children admitted to U.S. hospitals between 1997 and 2012. The increase in overdoses is possibly due to the rise in prescribed painkillers, such as OxyContin and Vicodin. Young children are often exposed to these drugs by finding pills on the floor, getting into their parents' purses, or opening bottles. The study emphasizes the need for parents to limit children's exposure to these medications and for companies to improve packaging. The study also highlights the underreported issue of young overdoses in the pediatrics community. Additionally, the study found that heroin poisonings among children increased by 161%.

The war in Syria escalated as government forces and their Russian allies launched intense aerial assaults on opposition-held areas of Aleppo. The bombings killed about 100 people and knocked out running water for two million people. Efforts at the United Nations to revive a cease-fire collapsed, and hopes for humanitarian relief faded. The bombings left residents buried in debris and turned neighborhoods into rubble. The Syrian government announced a new offensive, including a ground operation, but analysts doubt their ability to seize and hold significant territory. Diplomatic efforts between Russia and the United States also disintegrated. The situation in Aleppo continues to worsen, with no end in sight.

Although the motive for the shooting is unclear, Cetin's ex-girlfriend had previously worked at the targeted department store. He had been charged three times with domestic assault and was under a court order not to possess a firearm. The FBI stated that terrorism was not suspected. Cetin is facing five counts of first-degree murder and is expected to appear in court on Monday. The shooting has deeply affected the small city of Burlington, and the victims have not yet been publicly identified. Survivors are still trying to come to terms with the tragedy, as the community joins the list of places known for mass shootings."

"This year is on track to be the warmest on record, and if carbon emissions continue to rise, record hot years will become the ""new normal"" by 2025. The damage has already been done, and the global average temperature of 2015 will be the norm by 2040. Extreme seasons will become the norm within decades if emissions continue as usual. However, there is still hope to prevent record-breaking heat at a seasonal and regional level with immediate action on carbon emissions. The Paris climate agreement's proposed emissions cuts are not enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. To keep global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius, emissions need to be slashed by an additional 25 percent by 2030. Despite concerns about President-elect Donald Trump's stance on climate change, world leaders and activists remain committed to battling climate change."

The Paris treaty was a push toward globalism and a boon for the liberals who dream of an elite class ruling the world.	President-Elect Donald J. Trump's policies could have catastrophic effects on the planet's climate. By withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and terminating President Obama's Clean Power Plan, Trump could push global temperatures to rise higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius, leading to devastating consequences such as extreme weather patterns and mass extinctions. While other countries are committed to their climate commitments, Trump's actions could encourage them to abandon their commitments and emit more greenhouse gases. Trump's denial of climate change and his intention to cut off American support for UN climate science further exacerbate the situation. However, climate activists and environmental leaders are determined to continue their efforts at the local and state levels, pushing for emissions-restriction plans and the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure. Despite the divisions between Democrats and Republicans on climate policy, there is bipartisan support for investments in clean energy and climate resilience. The construction of wind and solar power plants could not only address climate change but also boost U.S. manufacturing and reduce electricity costs. The willingness of Trump and Republican leaders to support such initiatives remains uncertain.

It seems to be caused by beetles and they are multiplying faster because of warm temperatures. I wish there was something more we were doing to stop climate change and these warm temps!	Millions of trees across the United States are dying due to a combination of factors including disease, insects, drought, and wildfires, all exacerbated by climate change. One example is the rapid ohi'a death disease in Hawaii, which has infected nearly 50,000 acres of native forest. The cause of this disease is still unknown, and scientists are struggling to find a treatment. In California, an invasive pathogen called Sudden Oak Death is killing millions of trees, including redwoods. Bark beetles and mountain pine beetles are also wreaking havoc on forests, expanding their range due to climate change. The loss of trees has far-reaching consequences, affecting clean water, carbon storage, and entire ecosystems. Scientists are working on genetic research to understand why some trees are able to survive these threats, but they warn that in a few decades, American forests may be unrecognizable.

Apparently, outdated rules put them at high risk for HIV and they can not donate for fear of spreading HIV. This is super discriminatory as HIV is not just found in gay men. People instead should be appropriately tested for HIV.	Gay men are unable to donate blood to victims of the Orlando shooting due to a year-long celibacy requirement imposed by the FDA. These regulations were implemented in 2015, supposedly ending the ban on gay men's blood, but still prevent even monogamous gay men from donating. The ban originated in 1983 during the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but the American Medical Association has called for its end, stating it is discriminatory and lacks scientific basis. Misinformation spread on social media falsely claimed the ban had been lifted in Orlando. The ban is seen as unjustified, and other countries, like Argentina, have already abolished it. The Council on American-Islamic Relations is helping to maintain blood supplies. The article calls for the end of this oppressive policy and highlights the need for continued resistance in the face of tragedy.

Some people suspect that the Russians actually poisoned him and the crash is a cover up! Not everyone's happy about this though as it might seem disrespectful.	The bodies of former Polish President Lech Kaczynski and his wife are being exhumed as part of a new investigation into the 2010 plane crash that killed 96 prominent Poles. The ruling party, Law and Justice, led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the late president's twin brother, has cast doubt on previous investigations and believes the crash was an assassination. They are seeking evidence against former Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who they believe had some involvement. The exhumations will involve tests to determine the cause of the crash, including checking for explosives. The exhumations are controversial, with some dismissing conspiracy theories and others upset at the violation of cultural taboos. The crash occurred while the delegation was traveling to honor Polish officers murdered by the Soviet secret police during World War II.

The flood-ravaged state of Louisiana may face a population loss as residents consider leaving after the flood waters recede. While few people have confirmed their departure, it is a topic of discussion among many. The state's economy will suffer if there is a decline in population, as it will reduce spending and tax revenue. Louisiana experienced a 6% population decrease after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, taking over five years to recover. Although this year's exodus is unlikely to be as severe, the shortage of available housing and the closure of small businesses due to the flooding pose challenges. Additionally, the decline in oil industry jobs and the state's high unemployment rate further complicate the situation. The aid and insurance money that typically accompanies natural disasters may not be enough to prevent people from leaving, exacerbating an already struggling economy.

Over 14,000 Saudi women have signed a petition calling for an end to the country's male guardianship system, which requires women to have the consent of a male guardian for various activities. The campaign gained support online through a trending Twitter hashtag. Women in Saudi Arabia must obtain permission from a male relative for activities such as traveling, working, studying, and even leaving the country. The petition was delivered to the government, and the activists are awaiting a response. The male guardianship system also affects women's ability to rent a flat, seek medical treatment, or file a legal claim. The campaign has received an incredible response, with hundreds of women bombarding the Saudi King's office with telegrams supporting the cause. However, there is opposition from some Saudi women who argue for reforming the system. The activists are demanding that women be treated as full citizens and that an age between 18 and 21 be designated as the point at which a woman is considered an adult. There has been no official response to the petition yet.

The incident occurred at the Times Square station, and the victim was pronounced dead at the scene. The suspect, who was wearing a pink shirt and scarf, was apprehended by police. The motive is still under investigation, but witnesses mentioned a possible dispute between the victim and the suspect. The incident caused a temporary disruption in subway service. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority states that while many subway incidents are accidental, dozens of people are hit by trains each year. In a similar case in 2012, a woman was convicted and sentenced to 24 years in prison for pushing a man into the path of a subway train.

The British Government is supporting an oil drilling project in Uganda's Murchison Falls National Park, which poses a significant risk to the endangered Rothschild giraffe species. The project involves drilling multiple wells in the park, which is home to one of the last remaining populations of these giraffes. Leaked documents reveal that the British oil company, Tullow Oil, has been in talks with the government to provide taxpayer-backed loans and insurance for the project. Conservationists have been relocating giraffes away from the drilling sites to protect them.

A six-week-old girl died after falling down an elevator shaft in a Brooklyn apartment building. The mother attempted to push the stroller into the out-of-service elevator on the 23rd floor, but it wasn't there. Both the mother and the baby fell onto the roof of the elevator and then dropped further to the 17th floor. The baby was found unconscious and unresponsive and was pronounced dead at the hospital. The cause of death is still unknown, and an investigation is ongoing. The apartment complex has a history of elevator violations, with over 120 violations since 2005. The elevator involved in the incident had been inspected recently, and one non-hazardous violation was issued. The building's elevator service company declined to comment, and the Elevator Industries Association did not respond to inquiries. The incident is now under investigation, and all elevators in the complex will be tested for safety.

"The Great Barrier Reef, although severely damaged, is not completely dead. It is currently on ""life support"" due to coral bleaching. The reef is home to numerous species and is considered the world's largest living thing. Preliminary findings show that 22% of its coral has died from the bleaching event. Climate change is the main cause of coral bleaching, as it leads to the expulsion of algae from the corals. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is conducting surveys to assess the impact of the bleaching. While scientists have expressed concerns about the reef's future, it is not beyond saving. The reef supports 70,000 jobs in reef tourism, and large sections of it are still in reasonable shape. The focus should be on better protecting the reef rather than giving up on it."

The Obama administration has announced that it will resume deportations of undocumented Haitian immigrants due to a surge in Haitian migrants seeking to enter the United States. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, deportations were suspended, but they were partially resumed later on for those convicted of serious crimes or considered a threat to national security. However, since last spring, thousands of Haitian migrants who had moved to Brazil for work have been making their way to the United States. These migrants have been allowed to enter the country and given permission to stay for up to three years under a humanitarian parole provision. With the full resumption of deportations, Haitians without visas will now be put into expedited removal proceedings. The surge in Haitian migrants has overwhelmed shelters in Tijuana, and many migrants have chosen to sleep on the streets. The change in American policy has surprised advocates in San Diego and Tijuana, who object to the policy change that does not reflect any actual change in reality.

Four Americans were killed in a suicide bomb attack at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. The attack also wounded 16 US service members and one Polish soldier. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it had been planned for four months. The US Embassy in Kabul will be closed as a precautionary measure. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg expressed support for those affected by the attack and reiterated NATO's commitment to fighting terrorism. Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. Urgent investigations are being carried out to determine how the attacker gained access to the base. This attack follows a series of recent attacks in Afghanistan, including a suicide car bomb targeting the German Consulate and a joint Afghan-US battle against the Taliban that resulted in civilian and military casualties.

"Preliminary data released by the FBI show a 20% decrease in the number of police officers intentionally killed in the line of duty in 2015 compared to 2014. This contradicts the belief that increased criticism of police, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, has led to a ""war on cops."" However, the president of the national Fraternal Order of Police disagrees with the data and believes that officer deaths are increasing. The FBI data also reveal that instances of officers being killed in unprovoked or ambush attacks have remained steady for the past four years. The reasons for the decrease in officer deaths are unclear, but better training and policies are among the possible factors."

Russia has claimed that the UN aid convoy that was bombed in Syria on Monday night was escorted by terrorists, denying accusations that it was behind the attack. The convoy, which was delivering food aid to opposition-held parts of Aleppo, was hit shortly after the end of a ceasefire. The Russian defense ministry released drone footage showing a pickup truck carrying militants and a heavy mortar driving alongside the convoy before it was bombed. More than a dozen people were killed, including the director of the organization. The truce collapsed as leaders were gathered at the UN in New York to negotiate a longer-term peace plan. The US accused the Syrian government and Russia of violating the ceasefire, while Moscow accused the US-led coalition of aiding ISIS. The incident highlights the deep mistrust between the superpowers and the failure to achieve a lasting agreement to end the conflict.

"President Obama oversaw significant growth in federal spending to reduce inequality, but President-elect Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress are likely to undo these measures. Trump's proposed policies, such as building a border wall, deporting undocumented workers, and cutting taxes, could lead to financial panic and a possible recession. The repeal of Obamacare and the proposed tax cuts would disproportionately affect the poor, with millions potentially losing access to healthcare and the highest-income taxpayers benefiting the most. In order to balance the budget, the GOP would need to make significant spending cuts, which would likely impact assistance programs for the young and poor. Trump's vague plans make it unclear which specific policies would be eliminated, but House Speaker Paul Ryan's ""A Better Way"" plan provides some insight into potential cuts. Overall, Trump's presidency could make it much harder to be poor in America and represents a repudiation of Obama's economic policies."

The film adaptation of Marion's story, titled ""Marion, 13 ans pour toujours - Marion, Forever 13,"" portrays the gradual descent of a young girl into depression and suicide. The film has prompted a discussion on social media, with many sharing their own experiences of bullying. France has attempted to address the problem with an anti-bullying law and a hotline for reporting incidents, but activists argue that more needs to be done. The issue of bullying extends beyond the school gates, with cyber-bullying also being a concern. Parents, teachers, and students are encouraged to openly discuss the problem to find a solution. Emilie's story, published in her diary, highlights the emotional and physical abuse she endured at school. A report by Unicef states that bullying is a global issue with severe negative effects on children's mental health. The recent attention on these tragic cases may lead to a change in how bullying is addressed in France."

The woman, 25, reported being attacked by two U.K. men last month, but instead of being treated as a victim, she was locked up and charged. She is currently on bail but cannot leave the country and needs $30,000 for legal fees. The men have returned to Birmingham, while the woman fears a long jail term for violating the United Arab Emirates' Sharia laws on sex. Her passport has been taken, and she is staying with an English family. The incident occurred during her dream adventure after leaving her IT consultancy career. The victim's family claims that the men took turns raping her while filming the assault. In the UAE, sex outside marriage is prohibited for couples, and single individuals are forbidden from having sex with married individuals. The victim's marital status is unclear.

A new study reveals that 28.6% of cancer deaths in the United States are caused by smoking. The research considered 12 smoking-related cancers and found that smoking is involved in 22.9% of cancer deaths in women and 33.7% in men. In 2014, an estimated 167,133 people died from smoking-related cancers. However, this number does not include deaths from other smoking-related diseases. The study also highlights geographic variations, with higher percentages of smoking-related cancer deaths in certain states. Tobacco control efforts have been credited with preventing eight million premature deaths, but many parts of the country still have weak tobacco control policies. The analysis only focused on cigarettes, excluding other smoking methods and secondhand smoke. The data relies on self-reports, which may underestimate smoking prevalence. The tobacco industry still holds influence, particularly in Southern states where most tobacco is grown.

Iraqi military and police forces have discovered a mass grave near the town of Hamam al-Alil, south of Mosul, containing around 100 decapitated bodies. The bodies were found at an agricultural college and are currently being examined to determine their identities. The Iraqi Joint Command condemned the Islamic State for their crimes against the people. Meanwhile, Kurdish peshmerga forces recaptured the town of Bashiqa, with heavy fighting reported. The US officials stated that 33,000 Iraqi civilians have been displaced so far by the Mosul operation, lower than expected. Aid organizations estimate that up to 1.5 million civilians have been living in Mosul under Islamic State control, and at least 700,000 are expected to be displaced. The international community is preparing for a humanitarian emergency, with emergency relief supplies being brought to areas where displaced people are expected to go. The United States is assisting in preparations for governance in Mosul and vetting the displaced, but these tasks will be handled by the Iraqi and regional Kurdish governments.

I am a 36-year-old male of the White race. I have a four-year bachelor's degree and earn 20000 USD. Trump's handling of Mexico has been atrocious. While illegal immigration may have fallen, it's no reason to treat such a big trading partner like a second class world citizen by telling them they have to pay for a wall. A wall which would be completely useless as far as keeping people out, because there are such things as shovels and boats. It's just completely absurd.	Mexico is bracing for the consequences of a Trump presidency, as his campaign promises of building a wall, renegotiating trade deals, and deporting Mexican immigrants threaten the country's economy and relationship with the US. The peso has already suffered a significant drop, and experts predict a turbulent financial future for Mexico. The election has also caused an existential crisis for Mexico, as it reflects the negative image the country has in the US. Canada is also concerned about the impact of Trump's presidency, particularly on trade. While some Canadians reacted with anxiety, others saw it as an opportunity for pride. The election has forced Mexico to rethink its relationship with the US, and President Peña Nieto has expressed his willingness to work with Trump. However, paying for a wall is out of Mexico's vision, and the country hopes to continue collaborating with the US for mutual development. The election will likely have the most profound impact on the economy, as the US and Mexico are deeply integrated in terms of trade and employment. Mexico is America's third-largest trading partner, and millions of American jobs are tied to trade with Mexico. Trump's argument that Mexico benefits more from NAFTA than the US resonated with some voters, but experts believe that Mexico has little leverage to apply pressure in the relationship. An economic crisis in Mexico could lead to a migration crisis, as Mexicans may seek work in the US. However, some believe that the threat from the outside will bring Mexicans together and encourage them to work harder. There is optimism that Trump's hostile talk will diminish once he takes office, and that economic factors will temper his policies towards Mexico. However, with the Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump's victory signals an ideological realignment in the US.

I really think Trump's days are numbered, whether it's impeachment or defeat in the next election.	"The Trump campaign has been pursuing a strategy of publicly courting black voters while privately seeking to depress their turnout, according to a BusinessWeek article. The campaign has three major voter suppression operations targeting idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. These operations include placing negative ads on select African American radio stations and using Facebook ""dark posts"" to deliver targeted messages. The campaign believes that depressing Clinton's vote total among these groups will benefit Trump. However, there is evidence that negative campaigning does not significantly depress voter turnout. Trump's approach to African Americans has been seen as insincere, with many of his events aimed at them taking place in predominantly white areas. As a result, Trump's polling among African Americans is poor, with him trailing Clinton by a large margin. While Trump's advisors believe that he doesn't need black votes to win, future Republican candidates will, and the campaign's efforts to suppress black voter turnout may harm the party's relationship with this demographic for years to come."

Many students are absent because their families cannot afford to buy food. One teacher reported that a student skipped class every Thursday because it was their family's designated day to buy food at government-regulated prices. Another teacher witnessed a child faint during a cultural event because they had only eaten an arepa at 10 a.m. and it was already 3 p.m. The government spends very little on meals in public schools, and a lawmaker criticized the government for prioritizing weapons over food. A recent poll revealed that 48% of the time children do not attend school, it is due to food-related issues. Many children eat only twice a day or even just once, and for some, the school lunch is their only meal of the day. Some parents are considering changing their children from private to public schools, while others are contemplating taking their children out of school altogether. In addition to the food crisis, public schools are also facing infrastructure problems, with stolen computers and desks and a lack of funds for school supplies.

There was even a quote from Elton John talking about how influential Russel was in his own life, and the impact he had on his stardom.	Leon Russell, a musician known for his dynamic performances, has died at the age of 74. He emerged in the 1970s as a prominent rock 'n' roll performer and songwriter after working as a studio pianist in the 1960s. Russell's health had been declining in recent years, and he had undergone surgery and suffered a heart attack. However, he had plans to return to the road in January. Russell's period of stardom was relatively short, but he experienced a comeback in 2010 when he collaborated with Elton John on an album. Russell recorded numerous albums and was also a successful songwriter for other artists. He was known for his unique image and energetic stage presence. Russell's last performance was in July 2016. He began his career as part of the Wrecking Crew, a group of studio musicians, and later became a star in his own right. Russell's collaboration with Elton John brought him back into the spotlight after a period of relative obscurity.

Thompson criticized Johnson for focusing on the construction of the Golden 1 Center instead of projects that benefit the community. Johnson's Chief of Staff denied claims that the mayor violently attacked Thompson. Thompson expressed regret for promoting violence but still stands by his actions. He believes the money spent on the arena should have been used for public schools, community development, or helping the homeless. Thompson stated that he would pie the mayor again if given the chance. The Bay Area has a history of political pieing, with a notable incident occurring in 1998 involving then-San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.

Instead of using glasses, they adjust their position when grooming to compensate for their deteriorating eyesight. Researchers observed that older bonobos sat back and extended their arms farther than younger bonobos, and this behavior increased over time. This shift in position is believed to be an adaptation to their declining vision. The study compared grooming distances of 14 wild bonobos between the ages of 11 and 45. The findings could provide insights into human aging and the impact of evolutionary heritage on age-related deterioration.

James Rackover, a surrogate son to celebrity jeweler Jeffrey Rackover, and Lawrence Dilione have been charged with hindering prosecution, tampering with evidence, and concealing a corpse. The victim, Joseph Comunale, was stabbed 15 times and his partially burned body was found buried under a foot of earth. The motive for the attack is still under investigation, but sources suggest it may have been triggered by Comunale rejecting sexual advances. The suspects attempted to bleach the victim's blood from his clothes and used gasoline to try to burn his body. The case has shocked friends of Jeffrey Rackover, who described James as the son he never had.

More studies need to be done in order to figure out not if we can stop climate change, but how will it affect us all.	Climate change has had a broad impact on ecosystems, with evidence of its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. A study identified 94 core ecological processes, of which 82% showed evidence of impact from climate change. These impacts range from shifts in species ranges and changes in phenology to disruptions at the genetic and ecosystem levels. Species are adapting to temperature extremes, with changes in physiology and morphology. Changes in phenology, abundance, and distribution of species have also been observed. These impacts have implications for food security, as reduced genetic diversity, inconsistent crop yields, and decreased productivity in fisheries threaten resources. Changes in disease vectors and the emergence of novel pathogens and pests pose a direct threat to human health and resources. Understanding these impacts is crucial for adapting to and mitigating the influence of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

The cost of care has increased tremendously from the obesity epidemic in this country. According to the most current statistics, over fifteen million Americans can be classified as extremely obese.	The healthcare system in the United States is ill-prepared to treat obese patients, with doctors often unwilling to look past their weight and provide proper care. Obese patients face difficulties ranging from inadequate equipment to biased attitudes from healthcare providers. Doctors may spend less time with obese patients, fail to refer them for diagnostic tests, and attribute symptoms to their weight without investigating other causes. The lack of appropriate medical care for obese patients extends to treatments, with drug doses often not calibrated for obese patients and surgeons refusing to perform joint replacements unless the patient loses weight. The situation is further complicated by the fear of medical professionals of being penalized for complications and poor outcomes. The article also discusses the challenges faced by doctors and therapists in providing medical care to transgender patients due to limited knowledge and bias. The Mexican government's investigation into the disappearance of 43 college students in 2014 remains unsolved, leading many to question its ability and willingness to find answers.

Aiden Webb, a 22-year-old rock climber from Norfolk, died while attempting to scale Vietnam's tallest mountain, Mount Fansipan. His body was found six days after he set off alone for the climb. His girlfriend, Bluebell Baughan, had pleaded with him to get help after he got lost on the mountain. Webb slipped, injured himself, and got lost off the main trail due to a landslide. He refused Baughan's pleas to call for help and had to spend the night dressed only in shorts. In his last text, he asked Baughan to raise the alarm, but the message failed to get through. His body was eventually found in a stream, and local police concluded that he had drowned while unconscious. The cause of his death could not be ascertained due to embalming. Webb's parents described him as a joy to be around and expressed their close bond as a family.

Given the advance warning we’ve had about the dangers and progression of Zika, it is shameful the lack of progress that has been made globally.	The Zika virus has been known to scientists for decades, but it has only recently become a serious public health concern. The majority of infected individuals do not experience symptoms, making it difficult to test for. Pregnant women are particularly at risk, as the virus can cause birth defects. Zika primarily spreads through infected mosquitoes, but it can also be transmitted through sexual contact. There is currently no vaccine or treatment for Zika, but scientists are making progress in developing them. The virus is prevalent in many countries, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Zika was first discovered in monkeys in Uganda in 1947 and has since spread to various parts of the world. In the United States, there have been thousands of cases, with Puerto Rico being heavily affected. The CDC has issued travel warnings for Zika in many countries.

The Chicago Police Department is facing a digital archive that documents two decades of torture by its officers. The archive, called the Chicago Torture Archive, contains over 10,000 documents related to cases of torture between 1972 and 1991. These cases involved over 100 black men who were tortured by police officers to force confessions or intimidate witnesses. The archive, which will be housed at the University of Chicago, includes interrogations, trial files, journalism works, and records of activism. The launch of the archive coincides with recent efforts in Chicago to address police misconduct, including the passing of the Reparations for Burge Torture Victims ordinance. The archive's director hopes that the lessons learned from these cases can inform and inspire young activists. While the archive provides a comprehensive resource for studying the cases, there are concerns about privacy and whether victims and their families were made aware of the archive's existence. Despite these concerns, the archive is seen as an essential tool for academics, researchers, and historians to understand this dark chapter in Chicago's history. It also presents an opportunity for the police department to mend relationships with residents and increase transparency and accountability.

A man dressed as a construction worker vandalized Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, using a sledgehammer and pickax to smash the symbol. The man attempted to remove the star but was unsuccessful. He claimed that he wanted to auction the star to raise money for women who have accused Trump of sexual assault or harassment. The suspect was later arrested on a charge of felony vandalism. The star will be replaced, and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce intends to prosecute the vandal to the full extent of the law. Trump's star has been targeted multiple times in the past, with incidents of paint, graffiti, and other defacement.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) released its annual global gender gap report, revealing that the US has slipped to 45th place in terms of gender equality. This decline is attributed to a decrease in women's participation in the labor force and a shrinking number of women in senior positions. However, the US has closed its education gender gap. Globally, progress towards economic equality has slowed, with the gender pay gap persisting and women's labor force participation lower than men's. The report warns that the global economic gender gap is not expected to close until 2196. The lack of progress in economic equality is concerning, as jobs typically held by women are at risk due to technological disruption. The top-ranking countries in terms of gender equality are predominantly Scandinavian. The Global Gender Gap Index ranks countries based on the distribution of resources between men and women.

The E-Rate program, which provides subsidies for schools to enhance internet connections, has received bipartisan support and billions of dollars in funding. However, a study in North Carolina found that the program had no benefits for students and actually hurt their performance. Other research has also shown little to no gains in student achievement with improved computer access. Despite this, the program has continued to receive funding and has been plagued with fraud and lax oversight. Additionally, the push for more advanced networks and expensive technology may not be necessary, as many educational resources do not require high bandwidth connections. The funding for E-Rate comes from a tax on long distance telecommunications, which disproportionately affects lower-income households. The article suggests suspending the program until its effectiveness can be objectively tested, and exploring other options for using the funds.

The Forced From Home exhibit organized by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) aims to teach empathy for refugees by allowing participants to experience the journey of a displaced person. The exhibit has been attended by over 17,000 people, including 3,400 students. MSF hopes to communicate the reality of the refugee crisis and generate empathy in a time when anti-refugee sentiment is on the rise. The exhibit creates an empathetic response by assigning each participant a specific displaced person's identity and sharing personal stories from aid-workers who have served in MSF camps. The exhibit challenges the notion that empathy is a globalized response, as humans are wired to empathize with those in their immediate surroundings. However, empathy can be strengthened with practice and training programs have shown promise in changing people's responses to others' suffering. While empathy alone is not a solution to the refugee crisis, it is a necessary component in finding a genuine solution.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has escalated his conflict with the Kurdish opposition by arresting at least eight members of parliament from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), including the party's two leaders. The arrests have been criticized as an assault on Turkey's democracy and have drawn condemnations from European capitals and the United Nations. The crackdown on political opponents follows a failed coup attempt in July, with tens of thousands of people being arrested or dismissed from their jobs. The government has also been targeting Kurdish opposition politicians, linking them to Kurdish militant groups. The arrests of HDP lawmakers are seen as a turning point in the government's campaign of arrests and have raised fears of greater instability in the country.

The Confederate battle flag, a divisive symbol, has resurfaced in the context of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign and his supporters. The flag has been displayed at Trump rallies and used as a response to anti-Trump protests. The flag's resurgence raises questions about race relations under Trump and the influence of his campaign on white resentment and white nationalism. Historians note that the flag has had shifting meanings over time, representing white resistance to integration during the Civil Rights era and now symbolizing concerns about the displacement of white culture. While some Trump supporters argue that the flag represents heritage, others acknowledge that it has been hijacked by hate groups. Reports of discrimination and hate crimes targeting minorities have increased since the election, with many incidents invoking Trump and his campaign slogans. The flag's new context is perplexing to some Southerners who view it as a symbol of Southern sacrifice rather than a political statement.

Synagogues across the country have held prayer and healing services to address these emotions. While Jews have not been directly insulted by Trump, they fear that his presidency will create a hostile environment for minority groups. The Jewish community is overwhelmingly liberal and Democratic, leading to a sense of alienation from their fellow Americans. However, they also recognize the need for understanding and reaching out to Trump supporters. Jews are urged to reflect on their own actions and allyship with other marginalized groups. This new era has brought about a struggle for Jews to understand Trump supporters while maintaining their own values and finding solidarity with others.

Many of them are facing difficult circumstances, including food and medicine shortages, as well as neglect from their families. The siege imposed by pro-government forces has made it nearly impossible to find medicine to treat chronic diseases commonly experienced by older people. Overstretched medical facilities are unable to provide proper care, leading to more deaths. Some families have even abandoned their older family members due to the extreme conditions. The situation has left many older residents feeling weak, frightened, and helpless. Despite the dangers, some refuse to leave their homes, while others are trapped and unable to leave due to the siege. The older residents of Aleppo are struggling to balance their own needs with the demands of their families, often sacrificing their own well-being. The war has taken away their dignity and left them feeling isolated and afraid.

The previous popular variety, Gros Michel, was wiped out by a fungal disease called Fusarium wilt. The Cavendish replaced it but is now susceptible to a disease called Black Sigatoka. Additionally, a new strain of Fusarium wilt called Tropical Race 4 (TR4) is spreading and could devastate the banana industry. To combat these diseases, scientists are studying the genetics of wild banana varieties and banana pathogens to find resistant genes. However, there has been little effort and funding for this research. By increasing genetic diversity in cultivated bananas, the industry can reduce its vulnerability to diseases. Scientists have already identified the genome sequences of bananas and the fungi causing the diseases, which provides a basis for identifying disease-resistant genes. With the use of genetic engineering and plant breeding, these genes can be transferred into desired cultivars. It is crucial to increase the pool of genetic diversity in cultivated bananas to avoid repeating the history of the Gros Michel and Cavendish varieties.

The expulsion is seen as an appeasement to Erdogan's demand to close schools linked to exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan accuses of orchestrating a coup attempt. Turkey has arrested tens of thousands of people suspected of ties to Gulen since the coup, and Erdogan has pressured other countries to aid in the crackdown. Pakistan is one of the few countries to comply. The affected schools deny any affiliation with political organizations and are petitioning against the expulsions. Over 400 Turkish citizens will have to leave Pakistan, but Erdogan reassured the students that they would not suffer.

A new study in Science reveals that global warming has already affected every aspect of life on Earth, from genes to entire ecosystems. With just a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, major impacts are already being felt in natural systems. More than 80% of ecological processes that support healthy marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems show signs of responses to climate change. These impacts have consequences for humans, including increased pests and disease outbreaks, unpredictable changes in fisheries, and decreasing agriculture yields. Understanding the adaptive capacity in nature can help address these issues and apply the same principles to crops, livestock, and aquacultural species. The study emphasizes the need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as there are already significant and widespread impacts from climate change across biological systems.

No one should have to go without clean water, and because we live in the United States, it's especially true.	A new report by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) reveals that over 18 million Americans are supplied with drinking water that violates federal laws on lead content. The report states that the water crisis in Flint, Michigan is not an isolated incident, and that violations of national rules protecting against lead contamination are widespread. The NRDC's analysis of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows that 5,363 water systems, serving more than 18 million people, breached the federal Lead and Copper Rule in 2015. These violations include inadequate testing for lead and insufficient treatment to prevent lead from leaching into the water supply. The violations occurred in almost every state, with 1,110 community water utilities providing water that exceeded the EPA's actionable limit for lead. Despite the widespread failure of water suppliers, very few were punished by the EPA last year. Of the over 8,000 violations, enforcement action was only taken against 11% of cases, and penalties were sought for just 3% of violations. The EPA has acknowledged the challenges in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule and has intensified work with state drinking water programs. However, a revised rule will not be implemented until 2017 at the earliest. The NRDC emphasizes that unsafe drinking water is a national problem that requires a national solution. The failure of the system to detect violations is highlighted by the fact that Flint was not considered in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule last year, despite the well-known water crisis. The CDC has reported that lead levels in the blood of Flint children significantly increased after the city switched its water supply. The NRDC also revealed that water utilities often manipulate test results to downplay lead levels. The Guardian has reported that at least 33 US cities have used methods to mask the true level of lead in water tests. The report raises concerns about the extent of the issue and calls for a coordinated effort at all levels to prevent future crises.

Around 16 police officers were injured during clashes with protesters, who looted trucks and set fire to cargo on a highway. The shooting occurred when officers were trying to serve an arrest warrant, claiming that the man posed a deadly threat. However, the man's family disputes this, stating that he was unarmed and holding a book. The incident has reignited scrutiny of the police department, which previously faced controversy over the shooting of an unarmed black man. This shooting is the latest in a series of incidents that have sparked outrage and debate about race relations and law enforcement. The police department is currently conducting an investigation into the shooting.

A Halloween night crash in Chunky, Mississippi has resulted in the deaths of one adult and two children. The victims were riding on a trailer when it was struck by a vehicle on U.S. Highway 80. Two individuals died at the scene, while another passed away while waiting for a hospital helicopter. Several others were injured, some with life-threatening injuries, and were transported to three different hospitals. The names and ages of the victims, as well as their relationship to each other, have not been released. Investigators are currently at the scene.

At least two people were killed and many buildings and roads were damaged. The Prime Minister described the scene as ""utter devastation"" and estimated the damage bill to be in the billions of dollars. Powerlines and telecommunications were down, making it difficult to reach affected areas. A tsunami warning was issued but later downgraded. The aftershocks, including a 6.2 quake, added to the anxiety in an area still recovering from a deadly 2011 quake. The town of Kaikoura, a popular tourist spot, was heavily affected. Emergency response teams and the Navy were deployed to provide assistance. The quake also caused a slip dam breach and disrupted the dairy industry. Prime Minister Key postponed his trip to Argentina to address the disaster."

A new study reveals that human-induced climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires in the western United States over the past 30 years. The study shows that heightened temperatures and increased aridity since 1984 have caused fires to spread across an additional 16,000 square miles, an area larger than Massachusetts and Connecticut combined. The authors warn that further warming will exponentially increase fire activity in the coming decades. The study also highlights the role of climate change in exacerbating the recent California drought and the rise in fire incidents. Factors such as a natural climate oscillation and firefighting practices have also contributed to the increase in fires. The researchers emphasize the need to prepare for larger fire years due to climate change.

Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans took to the streets in Seoul for the second consecutive weekend, demanding the resignation of President Park Geun-hye. The protests were sparked by Park's admission that she shared classified information with someone lacking security clearance. The demonstrations, which included families, students, and union members, were some of the largest anti-government protests in decades. Four officers and 26 protesters were injured during the protests. Park's spokesman stated that she realizes the seriousness of the situation and is considering ways to normalize affairs. Protesters are calling for Park's resignation due to feelings of betrayal and frustration with her leadership. The protests also stem from other incidents, such as the Sewol ferry sinking. Despite roadblocks, protesters attempted to march to the presidential palace. The demonstrations will continue until there are answers and a resolution to the political turmoil.

"Azealia Banks tearfully shared her side of the Russell Crowe incident in a new interview. She described the argument that led to her being kicked out of Crowe's hotel room as ""humiliating."" Banks claimed that Crowe made disparaging comments about her career, and when she responded, the whole table turned against her. She alleged that Crowe called her the N-word, choked her, and physically removed her from the suite. However, a source close to Crowe denied these claims and stated that he acted in defense of his guests. Banks also expressed disappointment that RZA, who invited her to the party, did not stand up for her. RZA later contradicted Banks' narrative and accused her of threatening someone with a glass. Despite the backlash, Banks remains resilient and confident in her youth and music career."

"A female lawyer has accused Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of groping her in 1999. Moira Smith, who was 23 at the time, claims that Thomas grabbed her without her consent during a Truman Foundation dinner. Smith described the incident on Facebook before deactivating her page. She stated that Thomas ""cupped his hand around my butt and pulled me pretty close to him"" and later ""squeezed"" her behind. Smith's former roommates and fellow Truman scholars confirmed that she had described the incident at the time. Thomas has denied the allegations. This comes years after Thomas' confirmation hearings were marred by accusations of sexual harassment from Anita Hill. Hill recently wrote an op-ed about her experience, emphasizing the importance of believing women who come forward with allegations of sexual harassment or violence."

Coconut trees are facing threats from lethal yellowing bacteria in the Caribbean, Cote d'Ivoire, and Papua New Guinea, which could lead to a shortage of coconuts. Unlike other crops, coconuts cannot be stored in seed vaults due to their high water content, so maintaining living gene banks is necessary. However, these gene banks require a lot of space and are vulnerable to land grabs. Additionally, growing and breeding coconuts is challenging due to their long maturation period and the need for hand pollination. Efforts to isolate and freeze coconut embryos for preservation are still unreliable. Funding for coconut gene banks is also limited, as most coconut growers are small farmers. The future of the Coconut Genetic Resources Network (COGENT) is uncertain due to funding issues.

I worry what this disease could do to the local population of frogs. Tell anyone who has a pond to becareful with what they are moving in and out of their ponds.	A study suggests that garden ponds are contributing to the spread of deadly frog diseases in the UK. Ranaviruses, which can infect amphibians, reptiles, and fish, have devastated common frog populations. The research indicates that infected animals from aquatic retailers or the movement of species between ponds may be worsening the problem. The virus appears to be spreading faster than frogs can hop, and human-aided dispersal is likely involved. Ranaviruses are a group of viruses found worldwide, and they can kill common frogs by causing sores and blisters on their skin or internal bleeding. Genetic records suggest that ranavirus was introduced to the UK on two separate occasions. Garden ponds can act as stepping stones for infected animals to reach new sites, and the transfer of frogspawn or frogs between ponds may be aiding the spread of the virus. The study emphasizes the need to manage the risk of disease outbreaks while still supporting wildlife by adding ponds to urban gardens. Limiting the movement of potentially-infectious material is strongly advised.

Donald Trump's proposed environmental policies include eliminating the EPA, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, and cutting federal spending on clean energy. Environmental groups are preparing for a fight, as these actions could have significant negative impacts on the planet. The biggest threats posed by the Trump administration include backing out of the Paris Agreement, killing the Clean Power Plan, eliminating the EPA, appointing climate change deniers to lead the EPA and Department of Energy, cutting federal spending on clean energy, avoiding regulations on methane, and opening federal lands to oil and gas drilling. However, it may be difficult for Trump to repeal and revise these regulations, and there is still hope for the planet as clean energy initiatives and pollution regulations have widespread support among the American people. Environmental organizations are prepared to fight against these policies.

Yaffa Eliach, a Holocaust survivor and historian, passed away at the age of 81. She is known for her massive photography collection that memorializes the lives of Holocaust victims rather than focusing on their deaths. The collection, displayed in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, includes a photo of a young Yaffa Eliach taken on the day her home town was occupied by Germans. She was one of the few survivors from her town and spent years collecting photographs and documentation of every Jew who lived there. The collection became a principal exhibition at the Holocaust Museum and was installed in a tower. Eliach insisted that no photo be cropped, capturing people enjoying life before the massacre. She also wrote a book chronicling the history of her town. Eliach's work aimed to show the humanity of the victims and preserve their stories.

Moira Smith, who was 23 at the time, claims that Thomas grabbed her without her consent during a Truman Foundation dinner. Smith described the incident on Facebook before deactivating her page. She stated that Thomas ""cupped his hand around my butt and pulled me pretty close to him"" and later ""squeezed"" her behind. Smith's former roommates and fellow Truman scholars confirmed that she had described the incident at the time. Thomas has denied the allegations. This comes years after Thomas' confirmation hearings were marred by accusations of sexual harassment from Anita Hill. Hill recently wrote an op-ed about her experience, emphasizing the importance of believing women who come forward with allegations of sexual harassment or violence."

A new study by Arizona State University researchers found that middle school is the most stressful time for mothers. The study involved analyzing surveys from over 2,200 well-educated moms across the country, and mothers of only middle-school-age children reported the highest levels of stress, loneliness, and emptiness. Middle school is a challenging time for children, with raging hormones, changing bodies and brains, exposure to peer pressure and risky behaviors, and a desire for independence while still feeling dependent on parents. Parents often struggle to navigate these changes and may not realize that their children still want a relationship with them. It is important for parents to listen, be supportive, and not give up during this time. Developing a strong relationship during middle school can carry into the teen years and young adulthood. Mothers should also reach out to other moms for support during this challenging time.

Red squirrels in the UK have been found to carry leprosy, a disease that was eradicated in humans in Britain centuries ago. The squirrels were found to have two different species of leprosy bacterium, one of which is almost identical to a strain recovered from a medieval human skeleton. There is currently no evidence of squirrel-to-human transmission, but researchers are concerned about the health of the endangered red squirrels. The reason why squirrels, humans, and armadillos are the only known species to harbor the bacterium is still unknown. The discovery of leprosy in squirrels may help researchers understand how the disease manifests in humans and how it spreads.

Justin Ross Harris, a man from Georgia, is on trial for leaving his infant son to die in a hot car. Prosecutors argue that Harris left his son in the car for seven hours because he was pursuing extramarital affairs. Defense attorneys admit Harris's philandering but argue that his son's death was a tragic accident. The fate of Harris is now in the hands of the jurors. The trial has gained significant publicity, leading to the proceedings being moved 300 miles away. Harris faces charges of malice murder, felony murder, and cruelty to children. The prosecution emphasized Harris's illicit chats with women, including underage girls, on the day of his son's death. The defense argues that Harris's sexual behavior is unrelated to the death. The prosecution highlighted the position of the car seat as evidence that Harris could see his son. The defense claims that the investigation was biased and misled the jurors.

It is believed that about one out of seven children have levels of lead in their system that the EPA deems too high. After the outbreak in Flint, I can see for their concerns.	Chicago has shut down hundreds of public drinking fountains due to excessive levels of lead in the water. The ongoing crisis in Flint, Michigan has prompted other communities to test for lead, including the Chicago Park District. Testing revealed that nearly a quarter of outdoor fountains and 14 indoor fountains and sinks exceeded the federal standard for lead levels. Some fountains had lead levels 80 times higher than the permissible level. All fountains and sinks with high lead levels have been disabled and will undergo further testing and repairs. The lack of adequate testing for lead in public settings is a national problem, according to public health officials. Lead can have serious health effects, especially in young children, and there is no safe level of lead in the body. Lead pipes and fixtures are still common in communities across the country. While taking a sip from a single fountain may not seriously affect health, it can contribute to cumulative lead exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations like the homeless and children.

When she called her cell phone she was told that her daughter had committed suicide as a part of some social group that takes their own lives. It's sad to see kids seeking attention in this light.	A recent article in the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta has sparked a national debate in Russia about the role of social media in promoting suicide among young people. The article claims that Russia's most popular social network, VKontakte (VK), has numerous groups that encourage vulnerable young people to kill themselves. The article alleges that at least 80 recent suicides can be linked to these online groups. Critics have accused the article of sensationalism and placing too much emphasis on the internet as a cause of juvenile suicide. However, the article has also prompted law enforcement agencies to launch a criminal case over groups on VK that allegedly promote suicide. Russia has one of the highest rates of youth suicide in the world, and the article has brought much-needed attention to this serious issue.

Dr. Rosecrans a leading psychiatrist for the Navy was immersed in treating these patients. She worked there for almost fifteen years and had difficulty helping out these traumatized victims after their incarceration.	The mental health care provided to detainees at Guantánamo Bay has been compromised by a lack of training, ethical boundaries, and information about their treatment during interrogations. Psychiatrists and psychologists were often unaware of the abuse that had taken place, and were discouraged from asking detainees about their experiences. The quality of care has been criticized by human rights groups and defense teams, who argue that it has been negligent and ineffective. Many detainees suffer from psychological problems as a result of their treatment, but PTSD is rarely diagnosed due to the impracticality of treatment in the prison environment. The mental health personnel faced numerous challenges, including distrust from detainees and the blurred lines between medical care and interrogation. Despite these obstacles, they did their best to provide care to the prisoners.

Rescue teams are working to save more people trapped in the rubble of a collapsed 10-storey building in Kisii Town. The death toll currently stands at nine, with hopes of finding more survivors. The rescue efforts are being coordinated by the Kenya Defence Forces, Kenya Red Cross, and St-John Ambulance personnel. It is suspected that drilling underneath the building may have caused its collapse. The developer of the building is currently in hiding, and authorities are urging him to surrender for investigation. The blame game between the county and national governments has been criticized, with the focus being on rescue operations. Efforts are being made to save those still trapped, with additional tools and machinery ordered. The NCA is assessing adjacent buildings for safety, as they pose a danger to the rescue operations. All buildings in Kisii Town will be assessed to ensure their safety, and contractors are warned against violating construction procedures. This is the second incident this year, following the collapse in Huruma, Nairobi County. The developer of the Kisii building is being blamed for ignoring NCA warnings.

An investigation by Human Rights Watch has concluded that the deadly attack on a school in Syria was carried out by Syrian regime and Russian warplanes. Russia initially denied that any airstrikes had taken place, but satellite imagery and drone footage released by the Russian Ministry of Defence showed damage consistent with HRW's evidence. HRW has compiled video evidence and witness testimonies, and called on Russia to conduct a thorough investigation. This attack is one of many targeting civilian infrastructure in Syria, with over 4,200 schools damaged or destroyed during the six-year war. Efforts are being made to establish culpability for war crimes committed in Syria through the UN General Assembly and national courts in Europe and the United States.

"Maia Sandu, a presidential candidate in Moldova, is facing criticism for being a single woman. Former President Vladimir Voronin, who is chairman of the communist party, stated that presidential candidates should be married and campaign with their spouses. He refused to even shake Sandu's hand, calling her a ""betrayal of family values"" and a ""national disgrace."" Bishop Marchel, a leader in the Moldovan Orthodox Church, also attacked Sandu, claiming that her attitude towards Christian morality diverges from normal principles. Sandu defended herself, stating that being a single woman is not a shame. Voronin also criticized Sandu's opponent, Igor Dodon, but implied that Dodon is a preferable choice. Sandu has campaigned on a pro-European Union platform, while Dodon aligns his views with those of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The presidential election in Moldova will have a runoff vote on November 13."

"This year is on track to be the warmest on record, and if carbon emissions continue to rise, record hot years will become the ""new normal"" by 2025. The damage has already been done, and the global average temperature of 2015 will be the norm by 2040. Extreme seasons will become the norm within decades if emissions continue as usual. However, there is still hope to prevent record-breaking heat at a seasonal and regional level with immediate action on carbon emissions. The Paris climate agreement's proposed emissions cuts are not enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. To keep global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius, emissions need to be slashed by an additional 25 percent by 2030. Despite concerns about President-elect Donald Trump's stance on climate change, world leaders and activists remain committed to battling climate change."

Residents in war-ravaged eastern Aleppo received a text message warning them to evacuate within 24 hours before a planned assault. The message, likely sent by the Syrian government, also gave rebels an ultimatum to surrender or be killed. While there were no reports of bombardment by Monday afternoon, witnesses spotted fighter jets in the city. Russian warplanes have been backing the regime with airstrikes since September, causing destruction in Aleppo. The UN warned that the city is on the brink of starvation and lacks essential supplies. Turkey has been carrying out airstrikes in northern Syria to support the Free Syrian Army and plans to move on to Manbij after liberating al-Bab from ISIS. This move has stirred sectarian tensions and complicated efforts to free Syrian cities from ISIS control. Turkey considers some Kurdish militia groups as terrorists, while the US supports and arms them. The conflict between the US and Russia over which groups to target in Syria further complicates the situation.

Hate crimes against Muslims in the United States reached their highest level since 2001, with a 67% increase in anti-Islamic incidents in 2015 compared to the previous year. Experts and advocates attribute this rise to anger over terrorist attacks and anti-Islam rhetoric during the presidential campaign. The Council on American-Islamic Relations blames the mainstreaming of Islamophobia by public figures like Donald Trump for the increase in hate crimes. Overall hate crimes increased by 6.7% in 2015, with anti-black, anti-Jewish, and anti-sexual orientation incidents also rising. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported 201 incidents of election-related harassment and intimidation, and there were reports of hateful acts before and after Trump's election. The data is limited as many law enforcement agencies do not report hate crimes voluntarily. Analysts believe that the spike in hate crimes against Muslims is due to anger after terrorist attacks, prejudice against Muslims, and the labeling of Muslims as enemies. The professor who wrote about the surge in crimes against Muslims expects that the levels of hate crimes in 2016 are either at or above those of 2015.

She questions why GOP leaders did not stand up for women after they had defended the party against accusations of sexism for years. The author suggests that the party prioritized appealing to certain voters over appealing to women. She argues that Trump's comments were not just ""locker room talk"" but a confession of assault. The author highlights how the Republican Party ignored Trump's chauvinism and even used their influence to force Republicans to support him. She believes that the GOP will suffer in the election and calls for the political obituaries of Trump's defenders. The author concludes by stating that she will not vote for Trump and warns that the GOP will lose the women's vote if they do not defend them."

The minister for ethics and integrity had threatened to mobilize mobs against participants. Homosexuality is illegal in Uganda. This is the second time the LGBTI community has tried to hold gay pride celebrations this year, with the previous attempt resulting in arrests. The reason for the targeting of this event is unclear, as previous celebrations have gone unnoticed by the police. In 2014, a bill to further criminalize homosexuality was overturned in court.

Two divers, Patrick Peacock and Chris Rittenmeyer, were found dead in the Eagle's Nest cave dive area in Western Florida. They had gone diving with a third man who reported them missing. The bodies were found the next day in a dangerous area of the cave system. The cave is known for its allure and is a popular destination for experienced divers. However, it is also considered dangerous, and signs warn divers of the risks. The area had been off-limits for divers from 1999 to 2003. Only highly trained divers should attempt to dive there, as even skilled divers can be affected at dangerous depths. The cause of death has not been disclosed, and autopsy results are pending. Some people have called for the area to be closed again, while others argue that people should be allowed to dive there if they have the necessary training and experience. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission did not comment on whether the site might be closed.

The infections, caused by a species of bacteria called Elizabethkingia anophelis, have killed 15 people and sickened 33 others. The microbe is resistant to common antibiotics, making treatment difficult. The outbreak is unusual because the bacteria is typically found in hospitals, but many of the infected individuals have not had recent contact with healthcare facilities. Investigators are testing various products for contamination as a possible source. The outbreak is challenging to understand as little is known about Elizabethkingia. The bacteria is commonly found in soil and mosquitoes, and it thrives in moist biofilms. Previous outbreaks have been linked to contaminated taps in hospitals. The current outbreak is the first reported of this particular species of Elizabethkingia. Officials believe it is unlikely that the contamination comes from tap or groundwater, but the source remains unknown.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a viral infection that poses a greater threat to infants in the United States than Zika, but it is rarely discussed. CMV can cause permanent disabilities such as hearing loss, microcephaly, intellectual deficits, and vision abnormalities in up to 20% of infected infants. There is no vaccine or standard treatment for CMV, but there are hints that antiviral drugs may benefit some newborns. CMV is transmitted through contact with saliva and urine, often from diaper-wearing children to adults. Pregnant women often get it from toddlers, especially those in day care. However, few women are warned about this infection, and less than half of obstetrician-gynecologists provide information on how to avoid CMV. Some experts argue that education campaigns and infant screening for the infection should be carried out to prevent the devastating effects of CMV. Routine screening of newborns for CMV is being pushed to identify those who are infected early and provide them with necessary tests and treatment. A recent study found that infants with CMV symptoms at birth who took an antiviral drug for six months had better hearing and cognitive skills at 2 years. However, it is not yet known if antiviral medication is safe and effective for babies with only hearing loss as a symptom. CMV infection can have long-term effects on a child's development, and the full extent of these effects may not be known until the child is in school.

The risks associated with these ingredients include cancer, organ damage, and cardiac arrest. The severity of the threats depends on factors such as pre-existing conditions, the quantity of ingredients taken, and the length of exposure. The report lists the dangerous ingredients, including aconite, caffeine powder, chaparral, coltsfoot, comfrey, germander, greater celandine, green tea extract powder, Kava, lobelia, methylsynephrine, pennyroyal oil, red yeast rice, usnic acid, and Yohimbe. The report warns against the use of these ingredients due to their potential health risks. The CDC has reported that the use of dietary supplements in the United States is common, with over forty percent of the population using them from 1998 to 2004. Multivitamins and multiminerals are the most commonly used products.
211	4.2	2.125	Hey, I thought this was an interesting article about males born through medical fertilization. Apparently, these men are also more likely to suffer from the same problems as their fathers did with being able to have babies. It's sort of sad to think about it. The author suggest using a sperm donor instead, but I couldn't imagine doing that if I was in this situation.	sadness	1	6	5	25	70000	5.5	5.5	2.5	5.5	5.5	3.857	2.143	4.0	3.714	172	I am a 25-year-old male of the Asian/Pacific Islander race.

The author suggest using a sperm donor instead, but I couldn't imagine doing that if I was in this situation.	A recent study suggests that men conceived through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a type of in vitro fertilization, may have lower sperm concentration and more fertility struggles compared to men conceived naturally. The study focused on 54 men conceived through ICSI and found that they had lower average sperm concentration, total sperm count, and total motile sperm count. The researchers suggest that couples should be informed about this potential outcome before undergoing ICSI. However, the study also found that a low sperm concentration in fathers did not necessarily match the values found in their sons. Therefore, some men conceived through ICSI may still be able to father children naturally. It is recommended for them to start trying to conceive at a younger age, as fertility declines with age.

It's crazy to think that if the officers never confronted him for something unrelated, that there could have been countless more killings.	A suspected serial killer in Anchorage, Alaska was stopped by a police officer who was responding to a theft complaint. The officer, Arn Salao, was shot multiple times by the suspect, James Dale Ritchie, but managed to return fire and fight off his assailant. Another officer arrived at the scene and also fired at Ritchie, killing him. Ballistics tests revealed that the gun Ritchie used was the same one used in five other homicides in Anchorage in 2016. Ritchie had prior arrests for drugs and burglary and had recently returned to Alaska from West Virginia. Two of the victims linked to Ritchie's gun were identified as Jason Netter Sr. and Brianna Foisy, who were found dead in July. Another two victims, Bryant De Husson and Kevin Schuyler Turner, were found dead in August. The motive behind the killings is unknown, and it is unclear if Ritchie knew any of the victims. The police believe that the chance encounter between Officer Salao and Ritchie may have saved countless lives. Two other unsolved double homicides in Anchorage have not been linked to Ritchie.

"More survivors of the Leviathan II tragedy, in which a whale-watching boat capsized and killed six people, have filed a lawsuit against the tour operator. The lawsuit describes the terrifying moments after the boat capsized, with the ship pitching and rolling in significant waves caused by a shallow reef. The captain had stopped the boat to view sea lions when a swell rose into a larger wave, causing the vessel to heel over. One of the plaintiffs, Robert Goodfellow, was submerged beneath the sea for a considerable period of time before swimming to the surface. Another plaintiff, Marya Levin, pushed a cushion towards two other passengers who were in danger of being struck by rotating propellers. Goodfellow and Levin eventually reached a lifeboat and are now seeking damages from the tour operator for physical, mental, and emotional trauma. Other survivors have also filed lawsuits, including one detailing their attempts to escape the sinking ship and a class-action suit citing post-traumatic stress disorder. The tour operator has referred to the sinking as an ""act of god."""

"Leonard Cohen, the renowned songwriter and poet, died in his sleep after a fall in his Los Angeles home. His death was sudden and unexpected. Cohen, known for his religious imagery and themes of redemption and desire, was buried in Montreal next to his parents. He was born into a Jewish family and moved to New York in 1966 to pursue a career in music. Although he influenced many musicians and received numerous honors, Cohen rarely achieved mainstream success. His most famous song, ""Hallelujah,"" has been covered by countless artists. Cohen's work explored religion, love, politics, and the search for balance in life."

Could you imagine having dinner and a missile comes flying over your house? I am definitely glad I live where I live.	"Russia launched a major air offensive in Syria, targeting the rebel-held part of Aleppo just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with President-elect Donald Trump about their goals for ending the Syria crisis. The strikes were described as ongoing and were carried out by Russian Navy frigates and fighter jets. The Pentagon called the missile launches a ""show"" and stated that Russia already had enough firepower in Syria to cause serious damage. The Obama administration has been trying to negotiate a cease-fire in Aleppo for months, but the situation remains dire, with the city under siege and no aid allowed in since July. In addition to the military offensive, a joint report by the World Food Program and the Food and Agricultural Organization stated that food production in Syria has reached an all-time low, threatening to drive more people from their homes."

The death toll in the Mediterranean Sea has reached a new record number, with over 4,600 people dead or missing this year. The central Mediterranean route, mainly departing from Libya, has seen the highest number of deaths. The issue is not the lack of resources in rescue operations, but the instability and violence in Libya, where human traffickers exploit people's hopes for a better life. The Libyan Civil War worsened the situation, leaving vulnerable migrants in a dangerous position. Traffickers are increasingly unconcerned with safety, forcing migrants to make the journey in rough seas without proper equipment. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) advocates for long-term policies that provide information about the dangers of the journey and safe passages for migrants. The IOM is also fighting against a negative narrative on migration, highlighting its historical positive impact.

Over 3,800 people have died, averaging about 90 deaths per week. The largest migration of refugees since World War II is currently taking place, with over 65 million people displaced from their homes. Despite fewer people crossing this year compared to 2015, the death toll has increased. The main routes across the Mediterranean are from Turkey to Greece, Libya to Italy, and West Africa to Spain. Syria produces the most refugees, with nearly five million fleeing the country due to civil war. The war in Syria has also resulted in an estimated 430,000 deaths. While some refugees are resettled in countries like the United States and Canada, the majority seek asylum in Europe or remain in the Middle East. With no end to the war in sight, the refugee crisis and the loss of lives will continue.

The boat capsized off the coast of Rosetta, carrying an estimated 450 people, mostly young Egyptian men. The number of Egyptians attempting to cross to Europe has risen sharply in the last two years, due to economic pressure and a possible shift away from Libya as a departure point. Meanwhile, China and other Asian countries are under pressure to shut down tiger farms, which supply the black market with skins, bones, and other parts. The Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has voted to ban international trade in pangolins, the most trafficked mammal on Earth. The ban aims to protect all eight species of Asian and African pangolins, which are hunted for their scales and meat. A wildfire in California's Santa Cruz Mountains has threatened hundreds of structures, with nearly 1,100 firefighters working to protect homes and communication towers. Cooler weather conditions are expected to help contain the fire.

Actress Susan Sarandon has launched an online petition urging people to empty their bank accounts in protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The petition targets big banks such as Bank of America, HSBC, UBS, Wells Fargo, Chase, and Citibank, which are involved in supporting the pipeline. Sarandon argues that the pipeline will destroy sacred Native American sites and have severe environmental consequences. The petition asks signatories to withdraw their money and place it in credit unions until the banks divest and pressure the White House for an environmental impact statement. As of now, there is no evidence of people following through with the pledge.

Even desert areas of India get enough rainfall each year that a simple catchment system would solve all of a community's problems."	Overpumping of groundwater in Dhaka, Bangladesh is causing a water crisis that extends beyond the city center. The pumping has caused groundwater levels to drop significantly over the past 50 years, leading to water quality and supply issues in surrounding peri-urban and rural communities. The presence of naturally occurring arsenic in shallow groundwater further exacerbates the problem. The pumping is causing faster groundwater flow, which can transport contaminants like arsenic to deeper areas of the aquifer, even outside the city limits. This poses a threat to deep wells used for arsenic mitigation in these areas. The researchers used detailed subsurface measurements to model the geology of Dhaka and found that strong pumping and heterogeneity in the underground sediments affect the hydrology of the area. Heterogeneity refers to the way sand and clay are oriented underground and is critical to how contaminants move in groundwater. In a delta system like Bangladesh, the clay layers are chopped up, allowing water to move in unpredictable ways and creating uncertainty about well contamination. The researchers theorize that if pumping continues at current levels, some wells outside the city center could become contaminated sooner than expected. The low water levels caused by pumping could also compromise the operation of handpumps in these areas. Arsenic is tasteless, odorless, and colorless, making it difficult for communities to detect its presence in water without testing. The researchers' models showed that typical hydrogeological data used to assess well safety is not predictive in this type of heterogeneous system. This highlights the need for water quality monitoring and the development of artificial groundwater recharge methods to address the water crisis in the region.

Management and ownership at a Saskatoon dog kennel were warned about multiple serious problems with their animal care methods before the death of 14 large breed dogs. The kennel was warned about ventilation problems, among other issues, by a certified master trainer and kennel care expert. The SPCA also received a copy of the complaints but is unable to pursue them due to lack of power. The dogs died of heat exhaustion after a malfunction in the building's heating system caused the room they were in to become excessively hot. The kennel manager expressed remorse and stated that the upper-floor room where the deaths occurred has been closed off. The kennel will remain open. The kennel had previously received positive reviews from customers, but the trainer who raised concerns said that customers don't see the full picture. The trainer quit after management refused his suggestions and took his list of concerns to the SPCA. The SPCA is part of a coalition urging the provincial Ministry of Agriculture to reform legislation to better protect animals.

An investigation by Human Rights Watch has concluded that the deadly attack on a school in Syria was carried out by Syrian regime and Russian warplanes. Russia initially denied that any airstrikes had taken place, but satellite imagery and drone footage released by the Russian Ministry of Defence showed damage consistent with HRW's evidence. HRW has compiled video evidence and witness testimonies, and called on Russia to conduct a thorough investigation. This attack is one of many targeting civilian infrastructure in Syria, with over 4,200 schools damaged or destroyed during the six-year war. Efforts are being made to establish culpability for war crimes committed in Syria through the UN General Assembly and national courts in Europe and the United States.

Scientists have been working on developing birth control for men, and a recent clinical trial showed promising results. However, the trial was discontinued due to side effects such as mood changes, depression, pain at the injection site, and increased libido. The article highlights the side effects of various birth control options for women, which are equally as bad but have not been halted. Women have always borne the burden of birth control, and the article argues that men should share in the responsibility. The availability of birth control has been revolutionary for women, leading to wage gains, increased college enrollment, and a decline in teen pregnancies. The article points out the double standard in the standards for male and female birth control, with women being expected to endure more side effects. The article concludes by highlighting the hypocrisy that women face in exchange for reproductive freedom.

Republicans in Congress are concerned about potential losses in the upcoming election. They are accepting the possibility of a Hillary Clinton victory and a Democratic majority in the Senate. This has led to discussions about how Republicans should proceed after the election. They must decide whether to cooperate with Democrats and try to get things done, or to adopt a noncooperative strategy in hopes of regaining control in the 2018 midterm elections. There are also questions about the future of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the Supreme Court nominee. Republicans fear that Clinton will be influenced by progressive forces and that compromises will be difficult to achieve. They also worry about the dissatisfaction among their voters and the potential backlash if they work with Democrats. However, some Republicans argue that waiting until 2018 may be a better strategy. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer believes there is a moral imperative to get government working again and hopes to work with Republicans. Hillary Clinton is seen as someone capable of building relationships with Republican leaders. Overall, if Democrats win the White House and Senate, considerable effort will be needed to bring a new spirit to a gridlocked Congress.
386	6.2	6.875	This article about post-traumatic stress disorder is disturbing on many levels. This country really doesn't take care of our veterans. Not to mention the fact that Vietnam and Iraq were unnecessary wars in the first place. I worry we're headed for another war, and with the VA in the state that it's in, how can they possibly care for more war veterans? They can't meet the needs of the ones who already need help. It's heartbreaking to imagine these soldiers re-experiencing the war over and over again. However, I am glad to hear that there is help for people who have PTSD. I remember when we were kids and first hearing about PTSD in Vietnam vets, it was thought that no one ever recovered from it. Healing is possible, but the vets have to find the right people to help them.	sadness	2	6	1	49	15000	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	331	I am a 49-year-old female of the White race.

Healing is possible, but the vets have to find the right people to help them.	"PTSD is a misunderstood and stigmatized disorder that affects many veterans. It is estimated that 8 million Americans suffer from PTSD, with rates among Vietnam War and Iraq War veterans being particularly high. The negative connotations surrounding PTSD prevent many veterans from seeking help. Veterans want others to know that referring to them as ""weak"" is ignorant, as war experiences are incomprehensible to those who haven't lived through them. PTSD symptoms can be masked and go unnoticed, making it difficult to recognize. Many PTSD sufferers suffer in silence, fearing judgment and trying to appear strong. Contrary to popular belief, PTSD does not make individuals violent. Recovery from PTSD is possible, and veterans encourage others to seek help and know that they are not alone."

"Sharbat Gula, the Afghan woman known for her striking green eyes in a National Geographic cover photo, has been arrested in Pakistan for falsifying documents and staying illegally in the country. If convicted, she could face up to 14 years in jail or deportation. Last year, Gula was arrested on similar charges but was later released. Photographer Steve McCurry, who took the iconic photo, has expressed his objection to her arrest and is committed to helping her legally and financially. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) stated that they can only assist Gula if she registers as a refugee, but she falls under the category of ""undocumented migrants."" The arrest highlights the mounting pressure on Afghan refugees in Pakistan to return home, with over 370,000 Afghans being repatriated since July 1. Human Rights Watch has raised concerns about the situation, stating that millions of Afghans have sought shelter in Pakistan due to conflict and poverty in their own country."

"Former Democratic senator Evan Bayh is facing a tough race against Republican candidate Todd Young in Indiana. Bayh has been attacked for his multiple homes, high earnings, and corporate ties. However, he still has a chance of winning, with recent polls showing a statistical tie between him and Young. Republicans are facing a cash crunch, with Bayh having a significant edge in ad spending. If Bayh wins, it would be a significant blow to GOP chances of holding their majority in the Senate. Bayh's entrance into the race was seen as a recruiting coup for the Democrats, and his bipartisan appeal has given him an advantage. Young's pitch is that Bayh has transformed from a centrist to a supporter of President Obama's agenda, using his positions to land post-Senate business. The attacks on Bayh's wealth resonate in Indiana, where the culture is parochial and politicians often emphasize their ""Hoosier"" identity. Bayh wants the race to focus on his accomplishments, such as the Evan Bayh 21st Century Scholars Program. However, the race has become increasingly negative, with outside groups playing a significant role."

Experts have different opinions on how long it will stick around and how often it will return. Some believe it will behave like other arboviruses, recurring regularly with upticks in cases during the rainy season. Others predict that it will vanish in a few years, similar to chikungunya. The current outbreak in the Americas is due to the fact that people in the region had no immunity to the virus. Future outbreaks may be smaller if people develop immunity, but there could also be long lulls between outbreaks, allowing for a buildup of younger people who aren't immune. It is unclear if there will be fewer cases of microcephaly in the future due to the immunity gained from Zika infections. The impact of mosquito control efforts on young girls getting infected is also uncertain. It is unknown if Zika will strike Africa and Asia with the same ferocity as the Americas, but experts believe the two strains of Zika will be cross-protective. The uncertainty surrounding Zika's future affects the prospects for a vaccine. If Zika activity subsides, it will be difficult to conduct clinical trials to prove the vaccine's effectiveness. However, the fear of the virus's impact on developing fetuses may continue to drive demand for a vaccine.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has escalated his conflict with the Kurdish opposition by arresting at least eight members of parliament from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), including the party's two leaders. The arrests have been criticized as an assault on Turkey's democracy and have drawn condemnations from European capitals and the United Nations. The crackdown on political opponents follows a failed coup attempt in July, with tens of thousands of people being arrested or dismissed from their jobs. The government has also been targeting Kurdish opposition politicians, linking them to Kurdish militant groups. The arrests of HDP lawmakers are seen as a turning point in the government's campaign of arrests and have raised fears of greater instability in the country.

Kenya has threatened to withdraw its peacekeeping troops from South Sudan following the dismissal of their general.

"A new report by environmental group Amazon Watch reveals that the United States is driving the destruction of the Amazon rainforest by importing crude oil from the region. American refineries processed over 230,000 barrels of Amazon crude oil per day last year, with California alone refining an average of 170,978 barrels per day. The expansion of oil drilling in the Amazon poses a serious threat to the region, with proposed oil and gas fields covering an area larger than Texas. The destruction of the Amazon rainforest releases greenhouse gases and puts indigenous communities and biodiversity at risk. Ecuador's state oil company recently started drilling near the biologically rich Yasuni national park. Indigenous communities are at risk of pollution, displacement, and deadly illnesses. Amazon Watch is calling for a reduction in Amazon crude imports and the establishment of ""no go zones"" in decision making."

The Confederate battle flag, a divisive symbol, has resurfaced in the context of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign and his supporters. The flag has been displayed at Trump rallies and used as a response to anti-Trump protests. The flag's resurgence raises questions about race relations under Trump and the influence of his campaign on white resentment and white nationalism. Historians note that the flag has had shifting meanings over time, representing white resistance to integration during the Civil Rights era and now symbolizing concerns about the displacement of white culture. While some Trump supporters argue that the flag represents heritage, others acknowledge that it has been hijacked by hate groups. Reports of discrimination and hate crimes targeting minorities have increased since the election, with many incidents invoking Trump and his campaign slogans. The flag's new context is perplexing to some Southerners who view it as a symbol of Southern sacrifice rather than a political statement.
109	6.2	1.0	I feel that we are prioritizing efforts of saving the planet in the wrong way. We want to ban this or that, and that's great and all. However, we are missing the bigger picture. We need to focus on building a world that co exists with nature, instead of just saving little bits of it here and there.

Egyptian authorities have recovered 162 bodies from a sunken migrant boat in the Mediterranean, with the death toll expected to rise to nearly 300. The boat capsized off the coast of Rosetta, carrying an estimated 450 people, mostly young Egyptian men. The number of Egyptians attempting to cross to Europe has risen sharply in the last two years, due to economic pressure and a possible shift away from Libya as a departure point. Meanwhile, China and other Asian countries are under pressure to shut down tiger farms, which supply the black market with skins, bones, and other parts. The Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has voted to ban international trade in pangolins, the most trafficked mammal on Earth. The ban aims to protect all eight species of Asian and African pangolins, which are hunted for their scales and meat. A wildfire in California's Santa Cruz Mountains has threatened hundreds of structures, with nearly 1,100 firefighters working to protect homes and communication towers. Cooler weather conditions are expected to help contain the fire.

And to force them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment, is hardly productive. Instead we should focus on how these people can live differently than trying to merge them into general society.

Microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by malformed heads and stunted brain development, has been linked to the Zika virus. The severity of microcephaly can vary, but it often results in mental impairment. Detecting the condition before birth is difficult, leading to debates about abortion. Raising a child with microcephaly requires extensive care and support, which can be costly. Early intervention programs can help, but they often end after three years. The CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics have published guidelines for evaluating and caring for infants with Zika-related microcephaly. The cost of care for each child is estimated to be $10 million over a lifetime. Families with resources, like the Grounds family, can provide the best care for their child, but many others struggle. Nicholas, a child with microcephaly, has made progress with intensive intervention, but ongoing support is necessary. Parents of children with microcephaly need support throughout their lives. Genetic testing revealed that Nicholas inherited two mutated genes from his parents, causing microcephaly. The odds of their second child having the condition were one in four.

The NBA star broke his own cell phone out of frustration during the altercation. This incident occurred shortly before Scottie filed for divorce. Larsa informed the police that they were having marital problems and that Scottie would raise his voice, yell, and scare her. The police report states that Scottie admitted to the argument and breaking his phone in frustration. Larsa mentioned that she would be speaking to an attorney. No arrests were made, and there were no allegations of domestic violence. Scottie's unhappiness with Larsa's relationship with Future had been a point of contention between them.

"The eldest generation in Russia, known as the ""children of the war,"" are living in poverty. Despite surviving World War II and other hardships, they are struggling to make ends meet on a meager pension. The falling ruble and rising prices have made it difficult for pensioners to afford basic necessities. Many have resorted to selling apples and relying on secondhand clothing and homegrown food. Medical care is also a challenge, as the cost of treatment is often too high. The government's response has been inadequate, offering a one-time payment instead of increasing pensions. Despite these difficulties, pensioners in Oryol have found solace in a DIY school for the elderly, where they can learn new skills and find companionship. However, they still long for a better quality of life and feel frustrated by the lack of support from the government."

They had gone diving with a third man who reported them missing. The bodies were found the next day in a dangerous area of the cave system. The cave is known for its allure and is a popular destination for experienced divers. However, it is also considered dangerous, and signs warn divers of the risks. The area had been off-limits for divers from 1999 to 2003. Only highly trained divers should attempt to dive there, as even skilled divers can be affected at dangerous depths. The cause of death has not been disclosed, and autopsy results are pending. Some people have called for the area to be closed again, while others argue that people should be allowed to dive there if they have the necessary training and experience. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission did not comment on whether the site might be closed.

Indigenous communities in Labrador, Canada are protesting the construction of a hydroelectric dam due to concerns about the release of methylmercury into Lake Melville, which would contaminate their food sources. A study from Harvard's environmental scientist, Elsie Sunderland, predicts that the dam will expose communities to double the amount of methylmercury they currently ingest, potentially causing acute poisoning. The dam's developer, Nalcor Energy, acknowledges that methylmercury levels will spike but claims they will eventually return to pre-dam levels. However, Sunderland's study contradicts this claim. The study also highlights that other hydroelectric projects in Canada pose similar risks to indigenous populations. Indigenous leaders and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador have reached a compromise to address the methylmercury impact, but specific measures have not been determined yet.

Well apparently now the government is flipping out that its a nationwide problem. Or should I say the ""scientists"" are flipping out since we have never heard of lead in the water anywhere outside of the Flint MI disaster"	A new report by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) reveals that over 18 million Americans are supplied with drinking water that violates federal laws on lead content. The report states that the water crisis in Flint, Michigan is not an isolated incident, and that violations of national rules protecting against lead contamination are widespread. The NRDC's analysis of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows that 5,363 water systems, serving more than 18 million people, breached the federal Lead and Copper Rule in 2015. These violations include inadequate testing for lead and insufficient treatment to prevent lead from leaching into the water supply. The violations occurred in almost every state, with 1,110 community water utilities providing water that exceeded the EPA's actionable limit for lead. Despite the widespread failure of water suppliers, very few were punished by the EPA last year. Of the over 8,000 violations, enforcement action was only taken against 11% of cases, and penalties were sought for just 3% of violations. The EPA has acknowledged the challenges in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule and has intensified work with state drinking water programs. However, a revised rule will not be implemented until 2017 at the earliest. The NRDC emphasizes that unsafe drinking water is a national problem that requires a national solution. The failure of the system to detect violations is highlighted by the fact that Flint was not considered in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule last year, despite the well-known water crisis. The CDC has reported that lead levels in the blood of Flint children significantly increased after the city switched its water supply. The NRDC also revealed that water utilities often manipulate test results to downplay lead levels. The Guardian has reported that at least 33 US cities have used methods to mask the true level of lead in water tests. The report raises concerns about the extent of the issue and calls for a coordinated effort at all levels to prevent future crises.

However, a Boston-based company called ColonaryConcepts is developing bowel-clearing food bars and drinks that taste more like fruit smoothies and chocolate. These products have been tested in a phase 2 trial and have shown promising results in terms of effectiveness and patient satisfaction. The new colonoscopy prep is scheduled to begin phase 3 trials next year and could potentially enter the market in 2018. This alternative option aims to improve the tolerability and cleansing effect of the preparation process. It is important for patients to not put off colonoscopies, as they are crucial for detecting and preventing colon cancer.

Not a surprise	The world's wildlife trade policy body, CITES, is calling for better treatment and tracking of illegally traded animals that are confiscated by authorities. Between 2010 and 2014, over 60,000 wild creatures were seized, with a fifth of them being threatened species. However, wildlife advocates argue that animals often suffer after being confiscated, as they are sometimes sent to inadequate facilities, returned to traffickers, or released back into the wild where they can spread diseases. CITES guidelines state that confiscated animals should be sent back to the exporting country, a designated rescue center, or other appropriate places, with humane treatment ensured. However, this doesn't always happen due to cost, impracticality, or lack of designated rescue centers. CITES member countries have agreed to distribute a questionnaire to gather information on how nations deal with confiscated animals, and Humane Society International has offered recommendations on setting up rescue centers.

"In South Africa, private security companies are training anti-poaching guards to protect rhinos from poachers. The demand for rhino horns, which are used in traditional medicine and high-end ornaments, has led to a spike in poaching. The South African government has declared rhino poaching a ""national priority crime"" and has implemented initiatives to combat the problem. Private rhino owners have spent millions of dollars on security measures, but the fight against poaching remains challenging. The security industry plays a crucial role in protecting rhinos on private game reserves, but there are concerns about the escalating conflict and the potential for violence. Some believe that more focus should be placed on education and awareness to address the root causes of poaching."

The United Nation's has estimated somewhere around one million Burmese children have had to stop going to school and start finding jobs. And trying to find a job is where in the trouble lies, it's very heart breaking for the families but with little other choice what can they do?"	Two girls in Myanmar who were kept prisoner and tortured for five years in a tailor shop have sparked outrage and an investigation. The police had previously refused to get involved despite pleas from the girls' families. The girls, who were sent to work in the shop at the ages of 11 and 12, were denied contact with their parents, not paid, and subjected to abuse. The case highlights the issue of child slavery in Myanmar, where at least a million children are forced to give up education and work. The authorities' handling of the case has angered the public, who see it as evidence of a biased judicial system. It was only when a journalist got involved that action was taken, leading to the arrest of the tailor and her two adult children. The president has ordered a report on how the police handled the case and is taking a closer look at the work of the human rights commission. The journalist involved is receiving a presidential award for his efforts.

One estimate in the tens of thousands represents the number of infected expecting mothers. This is feared to result in fetal deformities."	Scientists are puzzled by the uneven pattern of damage caused by the Zika virus across Latin America. While the virus has infected over 650,000 people in the region, the majority of babies born with congenital neurological damage linked to Zika have been clustered in northeastern Brazil. Health officials and scientists are investigating other factors that may be contributing to the higher toll in this region, such as the presence of other mosquito-borne viruses or environmental and genetic factors. The number of cases of birth defects linked to Zika outside of Brazil has been relatively low, leading researchers to caution that it will take years to fully understand the dangers the virus poses to babies' brains. The outbreak in Puerto Rico is being closely monitored, but the mainland United States has so far averted a major outbreak. The lack of funding for Zika research and prevention has hindered efforts to accurately count the number of people infected and assess the true impact of the virus.

Women are concerned about the potential threat to affordable birth control under the Trump-Pence administration. Trump and Pence have expressed intentions to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which covers birth control. In response, some women are considering getting an intrauterine device (IUD) as a long-lasting form of birth control that could outlast any changes made by the administration. IUDs are highly effective and safe, with some versions lasting up to 12 years. Women are advised to take action soon, as an IUD can cost up to $1,000 without insurance coverage. Planned Parenthood offers a guide for those interested in learning more about IUDs. The fate of the Affordable Care Act and its birth control provisions is uncertain after President Obama leaves office on January 20, 2017.

Now, if you try to mention your opinion on social media, you run the risk of being attacked or insulted, simply adding to the fear of the current political situations.	A survey conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA) found that 52% of Americans consider the 2016 Presidential Election to be a significant source of stress. This stress is not limited to any particular political party and is exacerbated by social media posts, which can range from factual to inflammatory. Additionally, 38% of adults say that cultural and political discussions on social media cause them stress. The APA has provided a list of do's and don'ts for reading and reacting to election news. The stress trend is expected to continue until mid-November, as more people rely on online sources for news. While cable TV news remains the top source of election news, more millennials are turning to alternative sources for information.

Aiden Webb, a 22-year-old rock climber from Norfolk, died while attempting to scale Vietnam's tallest mountain, Mount Fansipan. His body was found six days after he set off alone for the climb. His girlfriend, Bluebell Baughan, had pleaded with him to get help after he got lost on the mountain. Webb slipped, injured himself, and got lost off the main trail due to a landslide. He refused Baughan's pleas to call for help and had to spend the night dressed only in shorts. In his last text, he asked Baughan to raise the alarm, but the message failed to get through. His body was eventually found in a stream, and local police concluded that he had drowned while unconscious. The cause of his death could not be ascertained due to embalming. Webb's parents described him as a joy to be around and expressed their close bond as a family.

Hate crimes against Muslims in the United States reached their highest level since 2001, with a 67% increase in anti-Islamic incidents in 2015 compared to the previous year. Experts and advocates attribute this rise to anger over terrorist attacks and anti-Islam rhetoric during the presidential campaign. The Council on American-Islamic Relations blames the mainstreaming of Islamophobia by public figures like Donald Trump for the increase in hate crimes. Overall hate crimes increased by 6.7% in 2015, with anti-black, anti-Jewish, and anti-sexual orientation incidents also rising. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported 201 incidents of election-related harassment and intimidation, and there were reports of hateful acts before and after Trump's election. The data is limited as many law enforcement agencies do not report hate crimes voluntarily. Analysts believe that the spike in hate crimes against Muslims is due to anger after terrorist attacks, prejudice against Muslims, and the labeling of Muslims as enemies. The professor who wrote about the surge in crimes against Muslims expects that the levels of hate crimes in 2016 are either at or above those of 2015.

"Multiple studies show that Trump's sexist rhetoric can have a significant impact on thinking, stress, and self-esteem. Women have expressed feeling gross and objectified by his comments, and even trauma victims have been distressed by his behavior. Trump's defense that his words are ""just words"" or ""locker room talk"" does not render them harmless, as rude language can impair cognition and lead to less creative thinking. Uncivil political discourse, especially in a presidential debate, undermines trust in government and discourages women from running for office. Discriminatory speech has negative consequences for women, leading to anger, depression, and lower self-esteem. Different types of discrimination can compound each other, with women of color experiencing even greater harm. Trump's candidacy exposes the bleak state of gender relations in the US and raises questions about how sexism will be taken seriously in the future."

The large Somali community in Minneapolis went through a rigorous screening process to enter the US, but younger generations are struggling to earn a living. Donald Trump's anti-immigrant stance is based on a false notion that the country's safety is at risk from Muslim extremists due to lax vetting policies. In reality, refugees face a lengthy screening process by the United Nations before coming to the US. However, once in the country, they receive limited support in terms of job-search help and cash assistance, making it difficult for them to integrate into the American economy. This lack of support contributes to refugee families' difficulty in escaping poverty and younger generations' sense of isolation.

"A study has found that projected climate change by 2070 will occur too quickly for grass species, including wheat, corn, rice, and sorghum, to adapt. This poses a risk to the world's ability to grow enough food, as these species provide almost half of the calories consumed by humans. The grass family is not only important for diets but also for global biodiversity and ecosystems. The study compared the rates of climate change niche change in grass species with projected climate change and found a significant difference. This suggests that many grass species may disappear from certain locations. While the study did not focus on food security, it highlights the potential problems for farmers growing food crops. However, there is ongoing research to develop ""climate-proof"" food crops using wild relatives of domesticated species. Unfortunately, these wild relatives are also at risk from climate change."

The Eastern Cape in South Africa is experiencing a surge in rhino poaching, with the 19th rhino killed this year on the Fish River Nature Reserve. Experts are alarmed by the increase in poaching, which they consider to be the worst in the province's history. The latest incident involved the killing of an 18-year-old black rhino cow, leaving behind a 1½-year-old calf. Black rhinos are critically endangered, with a global population of approximately 5,000 in the wild.
400	6.2	4.0	This is a sad story. There is a Rhino Orphanage, but a beloved rhino just passed about. They tried so hard to save this rhino, and unfortunately the baby rhino named Thula is the area that this happened in. It never gets easier.

The author expresses both sadness and relief at Isibindi's passing and hopes for the well-being of other orphaned babies.

At least 239 migrants are believed to have drowned in two shipwrecks off the coast of Libya this week, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Survivor accounts suggest that two overcrowded boats broke up just off the Libyan coast on Wednesday. The 31 survivors were taken to the Italian island of Lampedusa. If true, these shipwrecks bring the toll of dead and missing in the Mediterranean to 4,220 this year, the highest on record. Most of the migrants appear to have come from sub-Saharan Africa. The European Union is conducting a search-and-rescue operation in the western Mediterranean, but the focus remains on deterrence rather than protection. The shifting migration patterns have been a boon to smugglers, as demand has increased across the trickier North African route.

Toughie, the last Rabbs' fringe-limbed tree frog, has died, marking the extinction of his species. The frog, featured in the Photo Ark project, served as a symbol of the extinction crisis. Toughie's species was only described in 2008, three years after he was found during a frog rescue mission. The deadly chytrid fungus wiped out up to 85% of amphibians in Toughie's habitat. Photographer Joel Sartore, who photographed Toughie for the Photo Ark project, emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about extinction. He believes that people need to meet and fall in love with these animals to care about their preservation. The loss of species threatens healthy ecosystems and ultimately our own survival. Sartore warns that if we continue on this path, we could lose half of all species by the end of the century.

Members of the band Eagles of Death Metal, who were playing at the Bataclan concert hall during the Paris Attacks, attended a memorial in Paris to honor the 130 people killed in the coordinated terrorist attacks. The band's frontman, Jesse Hughes, praised the city's response to the tragedy.

Hughes later apologized for his statement. At the memorial, Hughes expressed his gratitude to the people of France. Sting's performance included a moment of silence and a statement in French to remember the victims and celebrate the venue's history.

The battle against the Islamic State has resulted in soldiers and civilians being injured or killed by chlorine gas, mortar fire, bombs, and artillery shells. The presence of civilians in the city has made the fight more difficult for Iraqi forces and airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition. The Islamic State has been using civilians as human shields, preventing them from leaving the city. The medical station on the outskirts of Mosul is treating injured civilians, but many are unable to reach medical assistance. The fight for Mosul is expected to be prolonged, putting more civilians at risk. The Iraqi military does not release overall casualty figures, but the toll is likely much higher than reported. The battle has also caused food shortages, forcing some residents to flee. The situation is dire, with injured children and desperate pleas for help.

The Transportation Department has released data on discrimination complaints filed against airlines, showing a 37% increase in such complaints this year. The move comes in response to concerns about discriminatory treatment by airlines, particularly incidents involving Muslims. The data revealed that 52 complaints were based on race, 8 on national origin, 1 on color, 2 on religion, and 4 on sex discrimination. In September, the department received 6 discrimination complaints, down from the previous year. Additionally, the report showed a decrease in complaints regarding the treatment of disabled passengers. The report also included information on airlines' on-time performance, flight delays, baggage handling, and incidents involving animals.

The reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who shot and killed a baby Salt River wild horse and wounded two others has increased to $25,000. Animal Recovery Mission, a non-profit organization, matched the existing reward fund. The Salt River Wild Horse Management Group, American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign, Humane Society of the United States, and Schill Law Firm also contributed to the reward. Despite the reward, no tips leading to the suspect's apprehension have been received. ARM Investigations, a coalition partner of the Salt River Wild Horse Management Group, decided to match the reward fund in hopes of encouraging a crucial tip. The organization fights animal cruelty and focuses on conservation programs. The witness saw a man shooting three Salt River wild horses, resulting in the death of a 6-month-old foal named Kai and injuries to two other horses. The horses are being monitored and treated by the SRWHMG. This is not the first time the wild horses of Salt River have been shot at, and the SRWHMG suspects they are being hunted. The organization is dedicated to protecting and studying the Salt River wild horses. The public can still contribute to the reward fund through a Go Fund Me page. The Maricopa Sheriff's department has not yet found any strong leads.

Coconut trees are facing threats from lethal yellowing bacteria in the Caribbean, Cote d'Ivoire, and Papua New Guinea, which could lead to a shortage of coconuts. Unlike other crops, coconuts cannot be stored in seed vaults due to their high water content, so maintaining living gene banks is necessary. However, these gene banks require a lot of space and are vulnerable to land grabs. Additionally, growing and breeding coconuts is challenging due to their long maturation period and the need for hand pollination. Efforts to isolate and freeze coconut embryos for preservation are still unreliable. Funding for coconut gene banks is also limited, as most coconut growers are small farmers. The future of the Coconut Genetic Resources Network (COGENT) is uncertain due to funding issues.

He expressed sadness over reports of harassment and urged his supporters to ""stop it."" Trump also criticized the protests that have broken out since his election, calling them ""horrible"" and blaming the press for exaggerating the incidents. He discussed his plans for FBI Director James Comey, saying he hasn't made up his mind about whether to ask for his resignation. Trump also addressed his stance on same-sex marriage, abortion, and deporting undocumented immigrants. He pledged to focus on deporting criminals and building a border wall. Trump defended his transition team, which includes lobbyists, saying that they know the system but will be phased out. He stuck by his claim that he knows more than American generals about fighting ISIS. Trump also expressed support for ditching the Electoral College and handing the presidency to the winner of the popular vote. He dismissed concerns about the impact of his presidency on his family's businesses, saying that saving the country is more important. Trump plans to turn down the presidential salary and does not intend to change his tone."

I think it's because of all the government regulations and  red tape that makes it difficult for a small business to start up and compete.  It's also of concern that US workers are stressed about job security.	"The US is facing an ""innovation crisis"" as other countries outperform it in measures of innovation. Economists attribute this decline to burdensome regulations and a weak job market. Some argue that the US's focus on individual self-reliance and smaller social safety net may discourage risk-taking. Studies show that demand-side factors, such as job insecurity and middling wage growth, are affecting entrepreneurship. Canada's maternity leave reform and France's unemployment insurance reform offer potential solutions to boost entrepreneurship. Policies that promote a tight labor market and full employment are crucial for the future strength of the US economy."

Maybe we should learn more about how to keep our ponds more sanitary for the frogs! I have noticed alot of frogs in mine, so this is interesting readying, anyway.  This is just another way that humans interfere with the natural environment, I guess.	A study suggests that garden ponds are contributing to the spread of deadly frog diseases in the UK. Ranaviruses, which can infect amphibians, reptiles, and fish, have devastated common frog populations. The research indicates that infected animals from aquatic retailers or the movement of species between ponds may be worsening the problem. The virus appears to be spreading faster than frogs can hop, and human-aided dispersal is likely involved. Ranaviruses are a group of viruses found worldwide, and they can kill common frogs by causing sores and blisters on their skin or internal bleeding. Genetic records suggest that ranavirus was introduced to the UK on two separate occasions. Garden ponds can act as stepping stones for infected animals to reach new sites, and the transfer of frogspawn or frogs between ponds may be aiding the spread of the virus. The study emphasizes the need to manage the risk of disease outbreaks while still supporting wildlife by adding ponds to urban gardens. Limiting the movement of potentially-infectious material is strongly advised.

Teach for America, an organization that recruits and trains teachers for schools serving underprivileged students, is preparing for the potential end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program under the Trump administration. The organization has 146 teachers who are not documented citizens and are protected under DACA. Viridiana Carrizales, who planned for a Trump presidency, has developed a plan to help these teachers relocate and navigate immigration issues. Teach for America got involved in immigration policy in 2012 when they lobbied for the DREAM Act. When DACA became an option in 2014, Teach for America provided resources to help aspiring teachers go through the approval process. The status of these teachers is causing concern for the organization's top executive, Elisa Villanueva Beard. Teach for America teachers with DACA status also have undocumented students in their classes and discuss these issues in a private Facebook group. Carrizales, who came to the US illegally from Mexico, worries about the 146 DACAmented teachers and their families. Despite the sadness and fear among the teachers, there is a sense of resilience and determination to come through stronger.

Conversion therapy is a set of practices aimed at changing a person's sexuality or gender identity to fit heterosexual or cisgender norms. It is often religiously motivated and can include methods such as talk therapy, electroshock therapy, and aversion therapy. A survivor of conversion therapy, TC, shared his experience of being subjected to these practices, including harassment and physical abuse. Conversion therapy has been linked to serious harm, including increased rates of suicide and mental health issues among LGBTQ individuals. While mainstream psychiatric organizations do not support conversion therapy, it is still promoted in some circles. Only five states and the District of Columbia have laws protecting LGBTQ youth from being forced into conversion therapy. TC, who escaped conversion therapy, emphasizes the need to recognize the harm caused by these practices and to treat LGBTQ individuals with dignity and respect.

"Thousands of women in Iceland left work early to protest the gender wage gap. They gathered in Austurvollur square in Reykjavik, shouting ""Out"" to discrimination against women. The protest highlighted the 30% pay gap between men and women in Iceland. The demonstration aimed to bring attention to the issue and demand change. Despite Iceland's reputation as a gender-equal nation, progress on pay equity has been slow. The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap ranking shows that Iceland still has gaps in earned income and wages for similar work. The report also reveals that global progress towards economic parity between men and women has suffered setbacks in recent years. The gender pay gap persists due to various factors, including women entering less well-paid professions and the time it takes for employers' implicit gender biases to change. The protest in Iceland emphasizes the urgency of addressing the gender pay gap and the need for faster progress."

The only real gripe I had was somehow playing with airsoft guns around the house are counted as sports related injuries so the data doesn't seem that reliable.	Eye injuries in youth sports are common and often involve activities that are not typically considered risky for eyes, according to a study of emergency room visits related to eye problems among athletes. The study found that about 30,000 sports-related eye injuries were treated each year at participating emergency rooms, with a majority occurring in people younger than 18. Basketball was the sport most likely to result in eye injuries, followed by baseball, softball, air guns, cycling, and soccer. While most injuries were minor, some required surgery and threatened athletes' vision. The study suggests that protective eyewear, such as wraparound glasses, could help prevent these injuries.

The Forced From Home exhibit organized by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) aims to teach empathy for refugees by allowing participants to experience the journey of a displaced person. The exhibit has been attended by over 17,000 people, including 3,400 students. MSF hopes to communicate the reality of the refugee crisis and generate empathy in a time when anti-refugee sentiment is on the rise. The exhibit creates an empathetic response by assigning each participant a specific displaced person's identity and sharing personal stories from aid-workers who have served in MSF camps. The exhibit challenges the notion that empathy is a globalized response, as humans are wired to empathize with those in their immediate surroundings. However, empathy can be strengthened with practice and training programs have shown promise in changing people's responses to others' suffering. While empathy alone is not a solution to the refugee crisis, it is a necessary component in finding a genuine solution.

Initially ruled as ""undetermined,"" the manner of death has now been amended to an accident with acute ethanol intoxication as a contributing cause. Lesin's death was caused by blunt-force injuries to his head, as well as injuries to his neck, torso, arms, and legs from falls. The investigation determined that Lesin entered his hotel room for the final time after days of excessive alcohol consumption and was found dead the next morning. The ruling of accidental death has been accepted by the interim D.C. police chief. Lesin was known for his role in the Kremlin-dominated media landscape and his volatile temper. He resigned as head of Gazprom-Media in 2014 and kept a low profile until his death. Speculation about his death included theories of foul play due to his land dealings in California, but a friend and business associate believed he died after heavy drinking."

Mexico will have to get their act together too,  I'm sick of them acting like saints everytime we want to take an action.	Mexico is bracing for the consequences of a Trump presidency, as his campaign promises of building a wall, renegotiating trade deals, and deporting Mexican immigrants threaten the country's economy and relationship with the US. The peso has already suffered a significant drop, and experts predict a turbulent financial future for Mexico. The election has also caused an existential crisis for Mexico, as it reflects the negative image the country has in the US. Canada is also concerned about the impact of Trump's presidency, particularly on trade. While some Canadians reacted with anxiety, others saw it as an opportunity for pride. The election has forced Mexico to rethink its relationship with the US, and President Peña Nieto has expressed his willingness to work with Trump. However, paying for a wall is out of Mexico's vision, and the country hopes to continue collaborating with the US for mutual development. The election will likely have the most profound impact on the economy, as the US and Mexico are deeply integrated in terms of trade and employment. Mexico is America's third-largest trading partner, and millions of American jobs are tied to trade with Mexico. Trump's argument that Mexico benefits more from NAFTA than the US resonated with some voters, but experts believe that Mexico has little leverage to apply pressure in the relationship. An economic crisis in Mexico could lead to a migration crisis, as Mexicans may seek work in the US. However, some believe that the threat from the outside will bring Mexicans together and encourage them to work harder. There is optimism that Trump's hostile talk will diminish once he takes office, and that economic factors will temper his policies towards Mexico. However, with the Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump's victory signals an ideological realignment in the US.

At least 55 people have died and dozens are missing after a boat carrying migrants capsized off the coast of Egypt. The boat, which was overcrowded with up to 450 migrants, sank near the city of Rosetta. So far, 163 survivors have been rescued and four suspected human traffickers have been arrested. The search for more survivors will focus on the boat's cold storage room, where witnesses say around 100 people were trapped. This incident highlights the dangerous journey that migrants are taking to reach Europe, with Egypt becoming an increasingly popular departure point. The UN refugee agency predicts that this year will be the deadliest on record for the Mediterranean.

Cows release methane gas, a greenhouse gas, which has a much higher negative effect on the climate compared to carbon dioxide. The livestock industry, including cattle breeding and farming, is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector. Livestock pastures and feed production use a significant portion of the Earth's land surface, leading to deforestation and habitat loss. The increasing demand for meat and dairy products contributes to the overgrowth of the farming industry and its impact on global warming. Producing one kilogram of beef emits an equivalent amount of CO2 as an average European car every 250 kilometers and consumes a significant amount of energy. Consuming less meat and dairy products is an effective way to reduce one's carbon footprint and protect the environment.

A former teacher, Alexandria Vera, has agreed to a plea deal after being accused of having a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old student. She pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child, a lesser charge than the original continuous sexual abuse charge. The relationship lasted for nine months, and Vera claimed that she and the victim loved each other. She said the boy's family accepted their relationship and even became excited when she became pregnant with his child. However, when Child Protective Services questioned her, she had an abortion.

Is it also causing problems in families. Who would think that lack of water would be the cause of violence, abuse, and neglect. Such a sad article.	The text discusses the forgotten victims of the drought in the western United States, particularly in Nevada. The lack of rain and snow has caused reservoirs to reach record lows, rivers to dwindle, and lakes to disappear. The drought has had devastating effects on the Native American tribes in Nevada, such as the Yomba Reservation, where ranchers have been forced to sell off their herds. The drought not only has ecological and economic impacts but also sociological and psychological ones, leading to domestic violence, substance abuse, and a sense of displacement. The article also mentions the importance of preserving native cultures and the efforts being made to help tribal communities survive the drought.

Protesters in Charlotte, North Carolina are demanding an end to racism and systemic oppression. They believe that true change can only happen by completely abolishing incarceration and the police department. They emphasize the importance of education and awareness about racism and injustice. The protesters argue that black lives need to matter for all lives to matter. They also call for more understanding of the justice system and individual rights. Some protesters highlight the historical context of racism in America and stress the need for new tactics to achieve liberation. They criticize the hypocrisy of the nation and compare the struggle for racial equality to the American Revolution.

The concierge, Abdulrahman, revealed that the robbers initially wanted money, not jewels. There was speculation that a diamond ring Kardashian West showed off on social media prompted the heist, but Abdulrahman clarified that the robber was only interested in money. After giving him the ring, the thief pocketed it and continued to demand money. Some jewels and gold were lost because the thief left the bag open. The police are still investigating, but no arrests have been made. Kardashian West has reduced her social media presence and public outings since the incident.

The shortage was caused by a leak in a pipeline that runs from Houston to New Jersey, resulting in over 300,000 gallons of gas being leaked. The states affected by the shortage include Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas. While prices have increased, they are still below $2.50 per gallon in many areas. The shortage has led to panic and frustration among drivers, with some gas stations completely running out of fuel. Efforts are being made to address the shortage, including repairs to the pipeline and alternative methods of transporting gasoline.

The incident occurred at the King Faisal Air Base, and the cause is currently under investigation. Jordan is a close ally of the United States and is part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria. The U.S. Embassy in Amman stated that they are in contact with Jordanian authorities and do not believe the incident was terrorism-related. The King Faisal base is used for joint exercises and training Western-backed Syrian rebels. There are over 1,000 U.S. military personnel based in Jordan, primarily serving as advisers.

ISIS has executed 232 people near Mosul and taken tens of thousands as human shields against advancing Iraqi forces, according to the United Nations. The terror group carried out mass killings as punishment for defying its orders. Since October 17, ISIS has taken tens of thousands of men, women, and children from the outskirts of Mosul into the city, intending to use them as human shields. Iraqi forces have launched an operation to cut ISIS supply lines west of Mosul. Reports indicate that ISIS has abducted thousands of families from various areas. The use of human shields is a violation of international humanitarian law. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned ISIS's strategy and urged those fighting ISIS not to carry out revenge attacks. The Mosul operation has already displaced thousands of people, and camps have been set up to accommodate them. Civilians continue to flee despite the risks involved.

Over half-a-million people lost electricity, but there were only a few injuries reported. Meranti did not directly hit Taiwan but came shortly after typhoon Nepartak. The storm is now expected to head towards China and is predicted to be the strongest typhoon to hit the area since 1969.
338	6.2	5.375	I read a very disturbing article about a recent study on depression resulting from birth control drugs.  The study was performed by the University of Copenhagen and has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study was extensive and performed over a decade. The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.	anger	2	5	1	61	16000	7.0	6.5	3.5	6.5	6.5	3.714	1.429	2.857	3.714	270	I am a 61-year-old female of the White race.

Hopefully men will share that soon.	A study from the University of Copenhagen has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study, which tracked one million Danish women for 13 years, found that women taking the combined oral contraceptive were 23% more likely to be diagnosed with depression, while those using progestin-only pills were 34% more likely. Teens were at the greatest risk, with an 80% increase in depression when taking the combined pill. Other hormone-based methods, such as the hormonal IUS/coil, the patch, and the ring, were shown to increase depression at a higher rate than oral contraceptives. The study suggests that the practice of encouraging teens to use these alternatives to the pill is misguided. The medical community's response to the study has been dismissive, with experts downplaying the link and offering paternalistic advice. The burden of avoiding unwanted pregnancy falls on women, despite the potential negative effects on their health and wellbeing. Effective alternatives to hormonal contraceptives exist, but they are often overlooked. It is important to remember that women are twice as likely to experience depression as men, and blaming women's depression on their biological femaleness is acceptable, but blaming medication formulated from synthetic hormones is not. The study's authors plan to research the possible association between hormonal birth control and suicide attempts or completions. While not every woman experiences depression and anxiety from hormonal contraceptives, it is important to acknowledge that many do, and their lives could be improved by recognizing and addressing this issue.

"More survivors of the Leviathan II tragedy, in which a whale-watching boat capsized and killed six people, have filed a lawsuit against the tour operator. The lawsuit describes the terrifying moments after the boat capsized, with the ship pitching and rolling in significant waves caused by a shallow reef. The captain had stopped the boat to view sea lions when a swell rose into a larger wave, causing the vessel to heel over. One of the plaintiffs, Robert Goodfellow, was submerged beneath the sea for a considerable period of time before swimming to the surface. Another plaintiff, Marya Levin, pushed a cushion towards two other passengers who were in danger of being struck by rotating propellers. Goodfellow and Levin eventually reached a lifeboat and are now seeking damages from the tour operator for physical, mental, and emotional trauma. Other survivors have also filed lawsuits, including one detailing their attempts to escape the sinking ship and a class-action suit citing post-traumatic stress disorder. The tour operator has referred to the sinking as an ""act of god."""

Over 1,800 public primary schools in Delhi will close to protect children from dangerous levels of air pollution. The decision affects more than a million children. The smog is a result of burning crops, fireworks, dust, and vehicle emissions. The most dangerous particles, PM 2.5, reached 600 micrograms per cubic meter. Sustained exposure to this concentration is equivalent to smoking 40 cigarettes a day and increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, asthma, and pneumonia. The pollution has caused visible effects on children, including coughing and difficulty breathing. Foreigners and elites have expressed concern about winter air pollution, and some embassies discourage families with children from moving to Delhi. Parents have reported symptoms such as burning eyes and congestion in their children. The city has taken these measures for the first time, and they hope weather conditions will improve soon. Keeping children at home reduces their exposure to air pollution, but indoor air quality is often not much better unless doors and windows are closed and sealed.

Sleep paralysis is a common sleep problem that affects around 8% of the population. It occurs when a person is awake and conscious but unable to move, except for their eyes. Sleep paralysis often involves nightmares or hallucinations and can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The causes of sleep paralysis are not fully understood, but stress and disruptions to sleep, such as alcohol or caffeine, can increase the risk. It can also be a symptom of other sleep disorders and mental health conditions. Kendall Jenner discussed her struggles with sleep paralysis, which may be linked to her anxiety and jet lag. Sleep paralysis is more common in people with mental health problems and young adults. For most people, it is not a chronic condition, but some individuals experience recurrent episodes. Practicing good sleep behaviors, such as avoiding alcohol and caffeine and sleeping on your side, can help prevent sleep paralysis. If it becomes a problem, a specialist may be able to prescribe medications to suppress REM sleep and alleviate symptoms.

The majority of these casualties were caused by airstrikes from a coalition led by Saudi Arabia. At least 329 civilians have been killed and 426 injured since the beginning of August. Saudi Arabia and its allies are trying to prevent an international investigation into possible war crimes. The United States and Britain, major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia, are finding it harder to ignore the bloodshed. The most recent example of the carnage was an airstrike on a market and residential area in Hodeidah, which killed at least 26 civilians. The United Nations has documented numerous attacks on civilian facilities by both coalition and rebel forces. Doctors Without Borders has pulled staff members out of six hospitals in Yemen after coalition planes bombed a facility. The United Nations has also expressed concern over the blockade of the city of Taiz, which has left residents critically short of food and water. The majority of civilian casualties have been caused by the Saudi-led coalition, according to a report to the Human Rights Council. Saudi Arabia and President Hadi's government have condemned the report as biased and have proposed a Yemeni commission to investigate human rights violations. Rights groups argue that a national body lacks expertise and that its reporting falls short of international standards. The European Union has drafted a competing resolution calling for a United Nations mission to Yemen. The Council will decide how to proceed after a week of diplomatic negotiations. President Hadi accused Iran of blocking the path towards peace in Yemen.

"Typhoon Meranti has caused damage in Taiwan and southeastern China, resulting in two deaths and dozens of injuries. The storm knocked out power and water supplies in both countries, with millions of homes affected. In addition, the storm caused the collapse of an 800-year-old bridge in China. Meanwhile, across the US, trees are dying at an alarming rate due to climate change, drought, disease, insects, and wildfires. California has lost 66 million trees since 2010, primarily due to drought and pine beetles. The spread of ""Sudden Oak Death"" is also infecting various plants in northern California. The presence of dead trees poses a significant fire hazard. Furthermore, a study has found that household dust exposes people to toxic chemicals, with phthalates being the most commonly found. This exposure can lead to serious health problems, especially in children."

A security crackdown in northern Rakhine state, Burma, following militant attacks has worsened the humanitarian situation and drawn international attention to Aung San Suu Kyi's government. The government has accused the Rohingya Muslim community of being behind the attacks, leading to a manhunt and reports of abuse by the military. The United Nations and the US have called for investigations into the alleged abuse and the restoration of humanitarian access. Human Rights Watch has reported burned villages and alleged rape of Muslim women by soldiers. The crisis is seen as a major test for Suu Kyi's new government, which is accused of not doing enough to address the Rohingya crisis. The Rohingya, who are essentially stateless, are considered illegal immigrants by many in the Buddhist-majority country. The security crackdown has displaced thousands of people and disrupted access to healthcare and food assistance. Suu Kyi has called for strengthening border security, following the rule of law, and creating a development plan for the area. However, the Rohingya community does not believe there is a militant group operating in the state and accuses the government of deliberate assassination. The crisis has further eroded confidence in Suu Kyi's government among the affected population.

Indigenous communities in Labrador, Canada are protesting the construction of a hydroelectric dam due to concerns about the release of methylmercury into Lake Melville, which would contaminate their food sources. A study from Harvard's environmental scientist, Elsie Sunderland, predicts that the dam will expose communities to double the amount of methylmercury they currently ingest, potentially causing acute poisoning. The dam's developer, Nalcor Energy, acknowledges that methylmercury levels will spike but claims they will eventually return to pre-dam levels. However, Sunderland's study contradicts this claim. The study also highlights that other hydroelectric projects in Canada pose similar risks to indigenous populations. Indigenous leaders and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador have reached a compromise to address the methylmercury impact, but specific measures have not been determined yet.

But what is the solution the problem they are talking about?  How should people intervene to save those animals?	The Bramble Cay melomys, a reddish-brown rodent, recently made international news when it was declared extinct. While climate change played a role in its demise, human inaction was the ultimate cause. Rising sea levels due to climate change destroyed the melomys' habitat and food sources. However, it was revealed that Australian researchers had planned to start a captive breeding program for the melomys, but they were unable to find any individuals on Bramble Cay. This missed opportunity highlights the tragedy that had been unfolding for years. In a new paper, biologist John Woinarski and colleagues argue that the extinction of the melomys, along with two other Australian species, could have been prevented. The Christmas Island pipistrelle and Christmas Island forest skink also suffered from human neglect and inaction, allowing introduced predators to decimate their populations. Australia's biodiversity conservation law lacks explicit commitment to preventing human-caused extinctions, leaving species vulnerable. These extinctions are often overlooked due to the small size and remote locations of the species. Australia has the highest rate of mammal extinctions in the world, with 30 species lost since European colonization. Woinarski's assessment is driven by personal grief and a desire to learn from past mistakes. Australia still has over a thousand threatened and endangered species, and action is needed to prevent further extinctions. While climate change did contribute to the melomys' extinction, it is important to recognize the other environmental factors and the human choice to not save the species.

"A man in Australia escaped with cuts to his leg after a shark collided with his surfboard near Byron Bay. The incident led to the closure of local beaches for 24 hours. The shark emerged from under the man while he was waiting for a wave, causing minor lacerations to his leg. The type of shark involved is unknown. This attack follows a similar incident in the same area a few weeks ago. The New South Wales coast has seen 14 unprovoked shark attacks in 2015, with a hotspot from Evans Head to Byron Bay. Efforts to control shark populations have been challenging, with a recent shark eco-barrier trial being canceled due to rough sea conditions. The government plans to increase tagging and relocation of sharks using ""smart drumlines"" to catch them. Shark attacks are on the rise due to the popularity of water sports and the movement of bait fish closer to shore, although fatalities are still rare."

A mass grave containing the bodies of hundreds of Iraqi policemen who were executed by ISIS has been discovered near Mosul. The grave was found by Iraqi security forces during their assault on the ISIS stronghold. The bodies are believed to have been buried as recently as October, just before the US-backed forces began their assault on Mosul. The grave was visited by Human Rights Watch, who found four exposed corpses and piles of rubbish covering other bodies. Witnesses reported that ISIS rounded up around 2,000 people from the area and forced them to head towards Mosul, separating the former policemen and driving them away. Gunfire and screams were heard on multiple occasions, indicating further executions. Human Rights Watch has called for ISIS to be held accountable for these crimes against humanity.

"Sally Brampton, the founding editor of Elle magazine in the UK, took her own life after health professionals failed to offer her help, according to an inquest. Brampton, who had a long battle with depression, drowned after walking into the sea near her home. She had sought help from a psychiatrist and GP but did not receive the assistance she needed. Two months prior to her death, she had been referred to mental health services but was not offered any help. The inquest revealed that crucial information about her condition had not been provided to the relevant services. The coroner concluded that there were missed opportunities to help Brampton, but it is uncertain if they would have changed the outcome. The mental health services have since made changes and no longer use faxes. Brampton was a respected journalist and author, known for her book ""Shoot the Damn Dog"" about her battle with depression."

"The UK government has approved the construction of a new runway at London's Heathrow airport, despite concerns about air pollution, noise, and the destruction of hundreds of homes. The decision is seen as a way to show that the country is ""open for business"" after the Brexit vote. The government rejected other options for expanding airport capacity and the decision will now be studied further and voted on by Parliament. Construction is expected to take years and could cost 2.6 billion pounds. Critics argue that the expansion is catastrophic for the environment and local community."

"A powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck central New Zealand, causing widespread devastation. At least two people were killed and many buildings and roads were damaged. The Prime Minister described the scene as ""utter devastation"" and estimated the damage bill to be in the billions of dollars. Powerlines and telecommunications were down, making it difficult to reach affected areas. A tsunami warning was issued but later downgraded. The aftershocks, including a 6.2 quake, added to the anxiety in an area still recovering from a deadly 2011 quake. The town of Kaikoura, a popular tourist spot, was heavily affected. Emergency response teams and the Navy were deployed to provide assistance. The quake also caused a slip dam breach and disrupted the dairy industry. Prime Minister Key postponed his trip to Argentina to address the disaster."

"Maia Sandu, a presidential candidate in Moldova, is facing criticism for being a single woman. Former President Vladimir Voronin, who is chairman of the communist party, stated that presidential candidates should be married and campaign with their spouses. He refused to even shake Sandu's hand, calling her a ""betrayal of family values"" and a ""national disgrace."" Bishop Marchel, a leader in the Moldovan Orthodox Church, also attacked Sandu, claiming that her attitude towards Christian morality diverges from normal principles. Sandu defended herself, stating that being a single woman is not a shame. Voronin also criticized Sandu's opponent, Igor Dodon, but implied that Dodon is a preferable choice. Sandu has campaigned on a pro-European Union platform, while Dodon aligns his views with those of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

"A 5.0 magnitude earthquake struck Cushing, Oklahoma, causing substantial damage to dozens of buildings. However, no damage was reported at the oil terminal, which is one of the world's largest. This was the third earthquake in Oklahoma this year with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater. No major injuries were reported, but there were cracks, fallen bricks, and facades damaged. The earthquake was centered 1 mile west of Cushing and occurred near a previous magnitude 4.3 quake. Aftershocks were feared, and parts of the city were cordoned off. An assisted living community was evacuated, and the Cushing Public School District canceled classes. Highways and bridges within a 15-mile radius of the epicenter were undamaged.

The treatment of children in the Calais camp is not just neglectful, but abusive. The camp is in a state of hardship, with most inhabitants gone and those remaining facing constant tension and the threat of fire and bulldozers. The French authorities promised to accommodate all refugees but failed to do so, leaving many homeless. Despite detailed census information, the authorities ignored estimates and abandoned almost 2,000 refugees. Help Refugees warned that housing minors in shipping containers would expose them to danger, and now there are approximately 1,500 children subjected to these conditions. The children report lack of basic necessities such as drinking water, clean toilets, and working showers, and are only provided with one meal a day. The authorities have shown little regard for their wellbeing and have failed to safeguard them. Arbitrary security measures and restrictions on volunteers further isolate the children and cut off their access to communication and legal assistance. Many refugees are sleeping outside in the cold and rain, exposed to danger. Despite the desperate conditions, volunteers continue to provide support. Charities received notice that children in the container camp will be transferred to accommodation centers across France, but there are no guarantees and the process may take time. It is crucial for charities to ensure that refugees in France receive better care.

Advocates for the West has filed a lawsuit on behalf of Western Watersheds Project to challenge the Forest Service's grazing decisions in the White Clouds Wilderness and East Fork Salmon River. The Forest Service has allowed heavy grazing and repeated violations on these public lands, despite acknowledging in 2003 that grazing was causing significant harm to resources. The lawsuit aims to protect the sensitive habitat for various fish species and improve management of the watershed. The grazing has also impacted recreational opportunities in the area. The groups are urging the Forest Service to take action and prioritize the preservation of these lands.

The hurricane has caused significant material damage, including the destruction of houses, crops, and trees, as well as a spike in cholera cases. The lack of urgency and support from the central government and international agencies has frustrated local officials and community organizations. The slow response has led to desperation among the affected population, with some resorting to looting. The centralization of resources in Port-au-Prince and limited aid funds have contributed to the dire situation. The priority now is to support farmers in the affected regions to recover and rebuild their livelihoods. The Lambi Fund of Haiti is working with partner organizations to clean canals, clear fields, and provide local seeds for planting. The text emphasizes the need for awareness and support from the international community to help Haiti achieve food sovereignty and recover from the disaster.

The Democratic Party suffered a shocking defeat in the recent election, with Donald Trump winning key demographics that were expected to support Democrats. Many Obama voters flipped to Trump, and he outperformed Romney among union households, whites without a college degree, and low-income households. The success of Obama's coalition may have been due to his unique talent as a politician, rather than a stable majority. The Democratic Party is now facing a struggle for dominance between Sanders supporters and the establishment wing. With no legislative victories in sight and upcoming electoral losses, the party's future is uncertain. Economic insecurity may have contributed to the rise of racism and far-right political parties. To prevent the views that led to Trump's victory, Democrats need to focus on delivering economic gains to working people.

The article sounds so sympathetic and bias. Why do people act like coming here illegally is not breaking a law? ""They haven't broken any laws!"" Yes, they have. You break the law when you enter illegally! What the fuck! And you got Liberal scholars defending immigrants, repeating that nonsense of, ""They don't break any laws!"" What the fuck? As a Mexican, I am appalled by other Mexicans defending this nonsense and seeing Mexico encourage this illegal immigration shit. Mexico needs to fix itself so that it can house people that won't want to run away from it. Fuck Mexico, they have ruined a lot of lives and they are not held responsible. Quit being politically correct about Mexico. Hold them accountable."	Mexicans are concerned about the economic damage that a Trump presidency might bring, particularly his promises to rewrite the trade deal and deport millions of unauthorized immigrants. Mexico's top economic officials tried to calm fears, stating that Mexico was in a strong economic position. The peso dropped in value after Trump's win appeared imminent. President Enrique Peña Nieto expressed his willingness to work with Trump. Mexicans are unsure if Trump's words will match his actions as president. Some economists predict a recession if Trump pursues his outlined plans. Mexicans are also worried about the deportation of illegal immigrants. The election has reshuffled Mexico's domestic politics, with a potential nationalist backlash in the upcoming presidential election.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a viral infection that poses a greater threat to infants in the United States than Zika, but it is rarely discussed. CMV can cause permanent disabilities such as hearing loss, microcephaly, intellectual deficits, and vision abnormalities in up to 20% of infected infants. There is no vaccine or standard treatment for CMV, but there are hints that antiviral drugs may benefit some newborns. CMV is transmitted through contact with saliva and urine, often from diaper-wearing children to adults. Pregnant women often get it from toddlers, especially those in day care. However, few women are warned about this infection, and less than half of obstetrician-gynecologists provide information on how to avoid CMV. Some experts argue that education campaigns and infant screening for the infection should be carried out to prevent the devastating effects of CMV. Routine screening of newborns for CMV is being pushed to identify those who are infected early and provide them with necessary tests and treatment. A recent study found that infants with CMV symptoms at birth who took an antiviral drug for six months had better hearing and cognitive skills at 2 years. However, it is not yet known if antiviral medication is safe and effective for babies with only hearing loss as a symptom. CMV infection can have long-term effects on a child's development, and the full extent of these effects may not be known until the child is in school.

This is very alarming as just recently 1,800 school had been close in India because of the poor air quality. It seem that these particle from the smog and fireworks are so tiny that they can make there way in the small pockets of the lungs.	Over 1,800 public primary schools in Delhi will close to protect children from dangerous levels of air pollution. The decision affects more than a million children. The smog is a result of burning crops, fireworks, dust, and vehicle emissions. The most dangerous particles, PM 2.5, reached 600 micrograms per cubic meter. Sustained exposure to this concentration is equivalent to smoking 40 cigarettes a day and increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, asthma, and pneumonia. The pollution has caused visible effects on children, including coughing and difficulty breathing. Foreigners and elites have expressed concern about winter air pollution, and some embassies discourage families with children from moving to Delhi. Parents have reported symptoms such as burning eyes and congestion in their children. The city has taken these measures for the first time, and they hope weather conditions will improve soon. Keeping children at home reduces their exposure to air pollution, but indoor air quality is often not much better unless doors and windows are closed and sealed.

Police in Hope, Indiana, shared a disturbing photo of a mother passed out in her car from a drug overdose, with her 10-month-old son crying in the backseat. The incident highlights a growing trend of parents using drugs with their children in the car to avoid disapproval.

This case is similar to a previous incident in East Liverpool, Ohio, where a couple overdosed with their 4-year-old son in the car. The police hope that sharing these photos will discourage drug users from endangering children. The opioid crisis continues to claim the lives of about 78 Americans every day.

Mental health in the work place is very important for a long and energetic life. It seem like this bank doesn't even care. Employees have noted that there have been thought of suicide and hurting themselves as a result or the work load.	Former Wells Fargo employees have described the mental health nightmares they experienced while working at the bank. Many employees suffered from stress-induced migraines, severe anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems due to the high-pressure work environment and unethical practices. Some employees were rewarded for using unethical practices to meet unrealistic sales goals, while others were constantly observed and critiqued by managers. The experiences of these employees highlight the toll that a toxic work culture can have on mental health. Wells Fargo has acknowledged its failures and is making changes to support its employees and uphold a customer-focused culture. The extreme stress and involvement in illegal activity can worsen mental health problems. Even managers at the bank experienced severe depression and anxiety. The mental health nightmares extended to employees in the mortgage division as well, with bullying, punishment, and intimidation being common. Employees were constantly measured against each other and bonuses were sometimes blocked. The lack of compassion from supervisors during personal crises led some employees to quit. The experiences of these employees have left a lasting impact on their mental health and perception of Wells Fargo.

Adam Crapser, a South Korean man who was adopted by an American couple when he was 3 years old, is being deported back to South Korea. Crapser has spent 37 of his 41 years in the United States and has a family there. However, he is being held in an immigration detention center and will be deported as soon as the necessary arrangements are made. Crapser's life in the United States has been difficult, including being abandoned by his adoptive parents and experiencing abuse in subsequent foster homes. He has also had a criminal record, which makes him eligible for deportation. The deportation is a result of his adoptive parents and the adoption agency failing to register him for U.S. citizenship. Many intercountry adoptees face this issue, and Congress is currently considering a bill that would grant citizenship to all children adopted by U.S. citizens. Crapser hopes that the bill will pass, but it will be too late for him. The Adoptee Rights Campaign and others find his deportation appalling and are urging the community to call members of Congress to support a legislative fix.

For nearly a century, the Canadian government forcibly assimilated indigenous Canadians by taking them from their families and placing them in church-run boarding schools. These schools punished students for speaking their native languages or observing indigenous traditions, and subjected them to physical and sexual assault, medical experimentation, and sterilization. Photographer Daniella Zalcman's book, Signs of Your Identity, documents the lasting effects of this trauma through double exposure portraits of former students and related places or items. The system caused the death of at least 6,000 children, and the last Indian Residential School closed in 1996. The government issued its first apology in 2008.

Two earthquakes hit central Italy, causing further damage to buildings already weakened by the August quake. Although there were no reports of serious injuries or deaths, the aftershocks revealed structural weaknesses in the area and added to the psychological stress of the residents. The government has allocated 40 million euros for housing those displaced by the quakes and promised to begin reconstruction soon. Thousands of people slept in their cars as emergency shelter was inadequate. The towns of Ussita and Visso were particularly affected, with a large percentage of houses deemed uninhabitable. The historic bell tower in Camerino collapsed, but the mayor stated that previous reconstruction work had contributed to the absence of serious injuries. With winter approaching, officials are considering alternative solutions to tents for housing the affected population, particularly the elderly.

Arctic sea ice levels have reached their second lowest level ever recorded, according to scientists. The drastic melt in 2016, despite stormy and cool weather conditions, has surprised experts. The ice levels fell to their lowest point this year on September 10, covering about 1.6 million square miles, almost the same as in 2007. The reduction in sea ice has significant implications for the planet's temperature, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and the Arctic ecosystem. Experts warn that if sea ice continues to decline, there may be no more sea ice within three generations. The warming oceans will result in even less sea ice each subsequent winter. The annual refreezing process has already begun, but experts predict further dramatic losses in the coming years.

Keith Springer, an expert in killing small animals, is on a mission to eradicate an army of house mice that are endangering a remote colony of seabirds on Gough Island. The mice have multiplied and are feasting on the eggs and chicks of millions of seabirds, including the critically endangered Tristan albatross. Springer is working on an audacious plan to spray poison pellets from helicopters to kill the mice, but the operation is challenging and expensive. A campaign is underway to raise funds for the eradication project. If successful, the plan will save the seabirds and allow a new generation of albatrosses to thrive.

A woman in Los Angeles allegedly locked her 11-year-old son in closets for three years before he died. Teachers at his school had expressed concerns about his well-being, but social workers found no cause for alarm. The boy's stepfather believed he was living in Mexico until the mother revealed that he had died. The boy's body was found in a closet, severely malnourished and covered in pressure sores. The mother has been charged with murder and child abuse. The family lived in a one-bedroom house, with the boy kept hidden in closets and sedated with sleep medications. The other children in the family were aware of the situation but concealed it from their stepfather. The stepfather was devastated upon learning the truth and called the police. A public memorial was held for the boy, and the stepfather vowed to continue telling his story to prevent similar cases from happening again.

Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, is facing a tough re-election fight after years of comfortable victories. His decision to embrace Donald Trump has worsened his chances of winning. His opponent, Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel, has received significant financial support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Issa has tried to fight back by highlighting accusations made against Applegate by his former wife. In another California district, Representative Jeff Denham is also facing a tough re-election fight. Denham, like Issa, has expressed support for Trump. Both districts have a large and growing Latino population, which is expected to vote against Trump. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC have invested over $4 million to defeat Issa and Denham. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, has given over $1.6 million to Denham. Denham's refusal to disavow Trump has put him at odds with the editorial board of The Modesto Bee, the largest newspaper in his district, which has endorsed his opponent, Michael Eggman.

A study has found that humans have destroyed about 10 percent of Earth's wilderness since 1992, equivalent to an area half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of Alaska. The research team from Australia's University of Queensland defines wilderness as an area with no human development. The destruction is primarily due to activities such as logging, agriculture, mining, and oil and gas exploration. The study aims to raise awareness and calls for international policies to protect remaining wilderness areas. The loss of wilderness is particularly significant in South America, which has experienced a 30 percent decline. The researchers warn that once wilderness is gone, it cannot be restored, emphasizing the need to protect what is left. The report criticizes the United Nations and others for ignoring the problem and highlights the urgency of taking action to prevent further loss.

I can't even comprehend why some people won't see how similar animals are to humans - how actually humans are animals. It blows my mind every day.	Aging bonobos have been found to develop farsightedness, similar to humans. Instead of using glasses, they adjust their position when grooming to compensate for their deteriorating eyesight. Researchers observed that older bonobos sat back and extended their arms farther than younger bonobos, and this behavior increased over time. This shift in position is believed to be an adaptation to their declining vision. The study compared grooming distances of 14 wild bonobos between the ages of 11 and 45. The findings could provide insights into human aging and the impact of evolutionary heritage on age-related deterioration.

And yet, others have their heads firmly buried in the sand and pretend nothing’s happening.	A report commissioned by Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand warns that climate change poses a significant threat to the world's coffee supply. The report highlights the impact of warming temperatures on farmland, which will reduce the global area suitable for coffee by about 50%. It also emphasizes the increased risk of diseases and pests, such as coffee rust and the coffee berry borer. Major coffee companies have been aware of these threats for years and have been implementing support programs for coffee growers. However, the report suggests that no single company is large enough to tackle the challenge of climate change on its own. The World Coffee Research group is developing adaptive strategies to address the issue, including preserving genetic diversity, creating a variety catalog, and evaluating new coffee varieties. Despite these efforts, there are still major gaps in knowledge on how to best help coffee producers adapt to climate change. The report raises concerns about the livelihoods of the 125 million people worldwide who depend on coffee, particularly those in developing countries. Urgent action is needed to prevent devastating consequences for these communities.

The woman noticed her blouse was on fire and saw a man with a lighter in his hand before he walked away. The incident is being investigated as a hate crime, but no suspects have been identified or arrested. This incident follows a recent attack where a Brooklyn woman allegedly beat two Muslim mothers and tried to rip off their hijabs. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has expressed concern over the increasing attacks on Muslims and called for more resources to prevent such incidents. Another attack in August involved a Queens man shooting and killing an imam and his assistant. The suspect in that case denies the charges.

Germany, which took in more asylum seekers than the rest of Europe combined, is facing the challenge of deciding who gets to stay. Syrians and Iraqis are almost guaranteed sanctuary, while Nigerians and Pakistanis are more likely to have their claims rejected. Even Syrians are increasingly falling short of winning full refugee status. Critics argue that asylum officials are turning a deaf ear to genuine petitions from asylum seekers arriving from countries outside the Middle East war zones. The German government is increasingly targeting migrants deemed ineligible for protection and is enforcing deportation more strictly. The system is flawed, with many appeals against the Federal Office's decisions and concerns about inexperienced decision-makers and declining interpreter quality.

The text discusses the ongoing debate over the best approach to fighting cholera. On one side are public health advocates who believe that vaccines can make a significant impact in preventing and treating cholera. On the other side are public health officials who argue that vaccines are not effective enough and that the focus should be on improving water and sanitation infrastructure. The World Health Organization (WHO) has tried to support both approaches but has not settled on how to fund them. Cholera is a deadly disease caused by contaminated water, and it kills about 100,000 people worldwide each year. Two oral vaccines exist, but they have limitations and do not address the underlying causes of cholera. The debate over vaccines has caused division and hindered progress in the fight against cholera. The text also mentions the history of cholera and the breakthroughs in understanding and treating the disease. It highlights the devastating cholera outbreak in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and the missed opportunity to distribute vaccines. The text concludes by mentioning new ideas and approaches, such as using mobile phones to report cholera cases and promoting water sterilization tablets.

The Mexican government seems very apprehensive about our new glorious President. Their economy might drop due to the building of the wall and lowering of all the immigrants trying to get into the U.S. by crossing into our borders.	Mexico is bracing for the consequences of a Trump presidency, as his campaign promises of building a wall, renegotiating trade deals, and deporting Mexican immigrants threaten the country's economy and relationship with the US. The peso has already suffered a significant drop, and experts predict a turbulent financial future for Mexico. The election has also caused an existential crisis for Mexico, as it reflects the negative image the country has in the US. Canada is also concerned about the impact of Trump's presidency, particularly on trade. While some Canadians reacted with anxiety, others saw it as an opportunity for pride. The election has forced Mexico to rethink its relationship with the US, and President Peña Nieto has expressed his willingness to work with Trump. However, paying for a wall is out of Mexico's vision, and the country hopes to continue collaborating with the US for mutual development. The election will likely have the most profound impact on the economy, as the US and Mexico are deeply integrated in terms of trade and employment. Mexico is America's third-largest trading partner, and millions of American jobs are tied to trade with Mexico. Trump's argument that Mexico benefits more from NAFTA than the US resonated with some voters, but experts believe that Mexico has little leverage to apply pressure in the relationship. An economic crisis in Mexico could lead to a migration crisis, as Mexicans may seek work in the US. However, some believe that the threat from the outside will bring Mexicans together and encourage them to work harder. There is optimism that Trump's hostile talk will diminish once he takes office, and that economic factors will temper his policies towards Mexico. However, with the Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump's victory signals an ideological realignment in the US.

Bankia was already in the limelight already due to being bailed out by the government in 13 million dollars.	Former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato and 64 other bankers are on trial in Madrid for an alleged credit card racket at Spain's Bankia bank. They are accused of using unofficial company credit cards for luxury purchases, totaling about €12m. The purchases were not declared to the tax authorities. Bankia was rescued in 2012 at a significant public expense, causing losses for small investors. Prosecutors are seeking jail time and fines for Rato and the former president of Caja Madrid, which merged with Bankia. Rato's successors at the IMF, Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Christine Lagarde, have also faced legal issues.

This might other protocols as well such as the Kyoto protocol	President-Elect Donald J. Trump's policies could have catastrophic effects on the planet's climate. By withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and terminating President Obama's Clean Power Plan, Trump could push global temperatures to rise higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius, leading to devastating consequences such as extreme weather patterns and mass extinctions. While other countries are committed to their climate commitments, Trump's actions could encourage them to abandon their commitments and emit more greenhouse gases. Trump's denial of climate change and his intention to cut off American support for UN climate science further exacerbate the situation. However, climate activists and environmental leaders are determined to continue their efforts at the local and state levels, pushing for emissions-restriction plans and the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure. Despite the divisions between Democrats and Republicans on climate policy, there is bipartisan support for investments in clean energy and climate resilience. The construction of wind and solar power plants could not only address climate change but also boost U.S. manufacturing and reduce electricity costs. The willingness of Trump and Republican leaders to support such initiatives remains uncertain.

They state that humans are causing climate change, with evidence of rising seas, warming oceans and atmosphere, melting ice, changing rainfall patterns, and increasing acidity in the ocean. The scientists criticize politicians and real estate developers without scientific experience who deny climate change. They express sadness that the Republican Party, historically supportive of environmental initiatives, is now rejecting climate science. The scientists emphasize the economic and social costs of inaction and call for rational decision-making to manage climate change risks. They also criticize the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, for wanting to scrap environmental agreements. The scientists highlight the success of renewable energy sources in reducing emissions and argue that action to reduce pollution does not harm the economy. They warn that voting for anti-science politicians will contribute to the climate change problem and urge voters to consider the conversation they will have with their children about their choices.

Despite significant progress in global vaccination efforts, measles still claims the lives of more than 350 children daily, according to a report by UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and other health agencies. The report emphasizes that the fight against measles is hindered not by a lack of tools or knowledge, but by a lack of political will to ensure every child is immunized. While vaccination campaigns and increased routine vaccine coverage have saved millions of lives, there are still countries where a majority of children are not vaccinated. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan account for half of all unvaccinated babies and 75% of measles-related deaths. Outbreaks of measles in various countries, caused by gaps in immunization, remain a significant problem. The report highlights the need to immunize young people who have missed out on vaccinations and notes that measles tends to resurge during conflicts or humanitarian crises.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended his surprise ban on most currency in circulation in India, which has caused chaos and inconvenience for millions of people. Modi argued that the ban was necessary to fight corruption and reduce the use of unaccounted-for cash in the country. However, opposition leaders and many citizens have criticized the move, as people have faced long lines at banks and ATMs, and many machines have run out of cash. Despite the hardships, some individuals expressed support for the ban, believing that it will ultimately benefit the nation. The transition to new currency notes has been complicated by the fact that many ATMs are not working and cannot dispense the new notes. The Finance Ministry reported that Indians have deposited about $45 billion in banned currency notes since the policy began, while banks and ATMs have given out $7.5 billion in new currency notes. The ban has had a significant impact on businesses, with sales falling and customers unable to pay with cash. While some individuals believe the ban is necessary, others argue that it is causing unnecessary suffering for the poor and that the real black money is hidden in Swiss bank accounts.

Protesters in New Delhi took to the streets to express their anger at the government's slow response to the city's severe air pollution crisis. The toxic smoke, caused by factors such as low winds, holiday fireworks residue, and crop-burning in neighboring states, has led to the closure of schools, canceled cricket matches, and a surge in patients with breathing problems. The air quality, measured by the PM 2.5 particulate pollutant, was more than six times the acceptable level. The city's chief minister announced emergency measures, including banning construction activity, limiting diesel-generator use, and closing a coal-fired power plant. However, experts argue that more long-term solutions are needed, such as expanding public transport and permanently closing aging coal-fired plants. The burning of crop waste in neighboring states is a major contributor to the pollution, and the government is being urged to take action. Protesters, including schoolchildren, are demanding immediate action to address the pollution crisis.

The treatment of children in the Calais camp is not just neglectful, but abusive. The camp is in a state of hardship, with most inhabitants gone and those remaining facing constant tension and the threat of fire and bulldozers. The French authorities promised to accommodate all refugees but failed to do so, leaving many homeless. Despite detailed census information, the authorities ignored estimates and abandoned almost 2,000 refugees. Help Refugees warned that housing minors in shipping containers would expose them to danger, and now there are approximately 1,500 children subjected to these conditions. The children report lack of basic necessities such as drinking water, clean toilets, and working showers, and are only provided with one meal a day. The authorities have shown little regard for their wellbeing and have failed to safeguard them. Arbitrary security measures and restrictions on volunteers further isolate the children and cut off their access to communication and legal assistance. Many refugees are sleeping outside in the cold and rain, exposed to danger. Despite the desperate conditions, volunteers continue to provide support. Charities received notice that children in the container camp will be transferred to accommodation centers across France, but there are no guarantees and the process may take time. It is crucial for charities to ensure that refugees in France receive better care.

Toughie, the last Rabbs' fringe-limbed tree frog, has died, marking the extinction of his species. The frog, featured in the Photo Ark project, served as a symbol of the extinction crisis. Toughie's species was only described in 2008, three years after he was found during a frog rescue mission. The deadly chytrid fungus wiped out up to 85% of amphibians in Toughie's habitat. Photographer Joel Sartore, who photographed Toughie for the Photo Ark project, emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about extinction. He believes that people need to meet and fall in love with these animals to care about their preservation. The loss of species threatens healthy ecosystems and ultimately our own survival. Sartore warns that if we continue on this path, we could lose half of all species by the end of the century.

As usual, Black bodies are not valued or the conditions surrounding them until the same things begins to plague white people. Zika was minimized and downplayed for over sixty years. That says alot.	The future of the Zika virus is uncertain. Experts have different opinions on how long it will stick around and how often it will return. Some believe it will behave like other arboviruses, recurring regularly with upticks in cases during the rainy season. Others predict that it will vanish in a few years, similar to chikungunya. The current outbreak in the Americas is due to the fact that people in the region had no immunity to the virus. Future outbreaks may be smaller if people develop immunity, but there could also be long lulls between outbreaks, allowing for a buildup of younger people who aren't immune. It is unclear if there will be fewer cases of microcephaly in the future due to the immunity gained from Zika infections. The impact of mosquito control efforts on young girls getting infected is also uncertain. It is unknown if Zika will strike Africa and Asia with the same ferocity as the Americas, but experts believe the two strains of Zika will be cross-protective. The uncertainty surrounding Zika's future affects the prospects for a vaccine. If Zika activity subsides, it will be difficult to conduct clinical trials to prove the vaccine's effectiveness. However, the fear of the virus's impact on developing fetuses may continue to drive demand for a vaccine.

If everyone had enough resources to live comfortably, things would surely improve.	Afghanistan is facing a looming humanitarian crisis as the number of displaced people continues to rise. Over a million people were already uprooted last year, and this year, at least another million Afghans are on the move within the country and across its borders. The violence and conflict in Afghanistan have forced many to flee, while others are escaping poverty and drought. The United Nations and other aid agencies are struggling to provide emergency assistance, and if they fail, it will become a full-blown crisis. The country has been plagued by massive displacement since the Soviet invasion in 1979, and the current violence is some of the worst since the Taliban was toppled. The clashes between Afghan and Taliban forces have pushed even more people from their homes. The government is unable to reach all affected areas, and the Taliban now controls more territory than at any time since 2001. The return of refugees to areas controlled by insurgents is a concern, as it could exacerbate insecurity and joblessness. The displaced are often rejected and forced into squalid camps, with limited access to clean water and food. The situation is dire, and the government is incapable of creating jobs or improving the economy in remote areas. Criminal and terrorist networks may exploit the jobless and displaced youths, further deepening the crisis.

Venezuela is currently facing political turmoil as President Nicolas Maduro's version of chavismo has brought chaos to the country and turned voters against him. The opposition has been pushing for a recall referendum to remove Maduro from power, but the government has been delaying and suspending the process. Venezuelans have taken to the streets in protest, but security forces and government sympathizers have responded violently. The military and paramilitary groups continue to support Maduro, but there are signs of cultural differences and potential divisions within the military. The opposition is calling for dialogue and negotiations, but many see it as a stalling tactic. The situation in Venezuela is uncertain and the future remains unclear.

Kim Kardashian West was held at gunpoint in a robbery in Paris, where a group of men stole millions of dollars' worth of jewelry. The concierge, Abdulrahman, revealed that the robbers initially wanted money, not jewels. There was speculation that a diamond ring Kardashian West showed off on social media prompted the heist, but Abdulrahman clarified that the robber was only interested in money. After giving him the ring, the thief pocketed it and continued to demand money. Some jewels and gold were lost because the thief left the bag open. The police are still investigating, but no arrests have been made. Kardashian West has reduced her social media presence and public outings since the incident.

"The residents of Matheny Tract, a poor community in California's Central Valley, have been living with contaminated water for years. They have had to pay for bottled water in addition to their tainted tap water. However, legislation based on the ""human right to water"" is now being implemented, and Matheny Tract will be the first community to receive clean water under this law. Similar legislation has been introduced in Michigan, but is still stuck in committee. The issue of water inequality in rural communities has been brought to the forefront by the state's record-breaking drought. Many small rural systems in California have contaminated water, affecting an estimated 160,000 people. These communities often lack public investment and are overlooked by their local governments. The right to water is seen as a fundamental human right, and California's legislation is seen as a step towards addressing water inequality. The state has also introduced a publicly accessible database on water systems that are out of compliance. Matheny Tract is scheduled to receive clean water on June 1, marking a significant improvement for the community."

The text discusses how Donald Trump was able to give a voice to the pain and anger of millions of Americans who felt ignored and dismissed by the political elite. These individuals had been poorly educated and lacked the words to express their feelings and experiences. Trump appealed to their fears and frustrations, promising to restore their world and make America great again. The text also highlights the long-standing anger and despair that has been building for decades due to job loss and economic changes. The media and policymakers often use clinical terms to describe the struggles faced by these workers, while corporations prioritize profits over human decency. Trump's supporters accepted his controversial actions because they felt he understood their perspective.

Three anti-poaching rangers, including two South Africans and a Mozambican, were attacked by angry villagers in Mozambique after apprehending a poacher. The rangers, including Sean van Niekerk, were whipped, stabbed, and pelted with rocks. Van Niekerk suffered a minor skull fracture, stab wounds, and injuries to his face and back. Despite the incident, he remains committed to saving wildlife. The attack occurred when the rangers were transporting the poacher to the police station and a mob from the community approached them. The police officers who were present fled, leaving the rangers to defend themselves until a helicopter arrived. Van Niekerk hopes that sharing this story will expose the incompetence and corruption of the police officers involved.

The death toll in the Mediterranean Sea has reached a new record number, with over 4,600 people dead or missing this year. The central Mediterranean route, mainly departing from Libya, has seen the highest number of deaths. The issue is not the lack of resources in rescue operations, but the instability and violence in Libya, where human traffickers exploit people's hopes for a better life. The Libyan Civil War worsened the situation, leaving vulnerable migrants in a dangerous position. Traffickers are increasingly unconcerned with safety, forcing migrants to make the journey in rough seas without proper equipment. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) advocates for long-term policies that provide information about the dangers of the journey and safe passages for migrants. The IOM is also fighting against a negative narrative on migration, highlighting its historical positive impact.

Protests erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black man was fatally shot by a police officer. Around 16 police officers were injured during clashes with protesters, who looted trucks and set fire to cargo on a highway. The shooting occurred when officers were trying to serve an arrest warrant, claiming that the man posed a deadly threat. However, the man's family disputes this, stating that he was unarmed and holding a book. The incident has reignited scrutiny of the police department, which previously faced controversy over the shooting of an unarmed black man. This shooting is the latest in a series of incidents that have sparked outrage and debate about race relations and law enforcement. The police department is currently conducting an investigation into the shooting.

"The Trump campaign has been pursuing a strategy of publicly courting black voters while privately seeking to depress their turnout, according to a BusinessWeek article. The campaign has three major voter suppression operations targeting idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. These operations include placing negative ads on select African American radio stations and using Facebook ""dark posts"" to deliver targeted messages. The campaign believes that depressing Clinton's vote total among these groups will benefit Trump. However, there is evidence that negative campaigning does not significantly depress voter turnout. Trump's approach to African Americans has been seen as insincere, with many of his events aimed at them taking place in predominantly white areas. As a result, Trump's polling among African Americans is poor, with him trailing Clinton by a large margin. While Trump's advisors believe that he doesn't need black votes to win, future Republican candidates will, and the campaign's efforts to suppress black voter turnout may harm the party's relationship with this demographic for years to come."

It makes me sad because we don't know the long-standing implications in the largest perspective. Every single day we can make choices to help negate the bad choices our species makes towards our environment.	A new study in Science reveals that global warming has already affected every aspect of life on Earth, from genes to entire ecosystems. With just a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, major impacts are already being felt in natural systems. More than 80% of ecological processes that support healthy marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems show signs of responses to climate change. These impacts have consequences for humans, including increased pests and disease outbreaks, unpredictable changes in fisheries, and decreasing agriculture yields. Understanding the adaptive capacity in nature can help address these issues and apply the same principles to crops, livestock, and aquacultural species. The study emphasizes the need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as there are already significant and widespread impacts from climate change across biological systems.

Iraqi Christians who were brutalized by the Islamic State and betrayed by their neighbors doubt they will ever be able to return to Mosul. The advance of the Islamic State scattered religious and ethnic minorities in the area, and the future of the region will be defined by who decides to return.

Iraq's news media has been showing images of soldiers recapturing desecrated churches, implying that it will soon be safe for Christians to return. However, Christians have been leaving Iraq for years, and community leaders say it will be difficult to go back to Mosul due to the pain and threats they experienced. Many Christians who do return would likely only do so to sell their houses and leave.

I hope that men will earn more fair wages in the future.	Male models are being paid up to 75% less than women, according to a top modelling agent. Elizabeth Rose, who manages male models at Premier, believes it is unfair and not a form of female empowerment. She explains that women can be paid up to £40,000 for a top show, while male models only receive £10,000 on average. However, she notes that the situation is slowly changing as advertisers are increasingly using male models for grooming products. Elizabeth also highlights that the top 10 female models all make millions, whereas only the top three male models earn over a million. She tries to negotiate higher fees for male models but acknowledges that women face more discrimination due to their age. Elizabeth believes that change can happen if more agents and models refuse to accept unequal pay.

"Sharbat Gula, the Afghan woman known for her striking green eyes in a National Geographic cover photo, has been arrested in Pakistan for falsifying documents and staying illegally in the country. If convicted, she could face up to 14 years in jail or deportation. Last year, Gula was arrested on similar charges but was later released. Photographer Steve McCurry, who took the iconic photo, has expressed his objection to her arrest and is committed to helping her legally and financially. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) stated that they can only assist Gula if she registers as a refugee, but she falls under the category of ""undocumented migrants."" The arrest highlights the mounting pressure on Afghan refugees in Pakistan to return home, with over 370,000 Afghans being repatriated since July 1. Human Rights Watch has raised concerns about the situation, stating that millions of Afghans have sought shelter in Pakistan due to conflict and poverty in their own country."

A woman appeared on The Dr Phil Show to share her horrifying experience of being sexually abused by both of her parents. The victim, Amanda, revealed that her parents forced her to have sex with them and even made her pose for explicit photographs and videos to sell online. Her mother, Justine, expressed remorse for her actions and admitted to making poor choices. Both parents were charged with sexual assault and exploitation and received 20-year prison sentences. Amanda also claimed that her mother coached her sexually and was a willing participant in the abuse. Despite the trauma, Amanda's parents would continue with normal family life after the abuse. Amanda has struggled to come to terms with the fact that her parents are now out of prison. Her father, Jim, has yet to apologize to her and has been described as manipulative. Justine blamed their behavior on money, stating that Jim discovered the profitability of child pornography. The episode has sparked discussions about child abuse and pedophilia on social media, with viewers expressing their horror and disgust.

A federal report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has concluded that the barrier separating humans and primates at the Cincinnati Zoo was not in compliance with standards for housing primates when a child fell into the gorilla exhibit in May. The report issued a critical citation because the barrier failed and caused harm to an animal. However, before the incident, the zoo had not been cited for shortcomings with the barrier during previous inspections. The zoo has since updated the barrier and is now in compliance with federal standards. The family of the child who entered the enclosure has stated that they do not want to pursue legal action against the zoo. The USDA has issued 10 citations at the zoo in the last three years, but none were related to the gorilla exhibit. The Cincinnati Zoo officials have reaffirmed their commitment to the well-being of the animals and the safety of visitors. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) has stated that the zoo meets their standards related to barriers.

Moira Smith, who was 23 at the time, claims that Thomas grabbed her without her consent during a Truman Foundation dinner. Smith described the incident on Facebook before deactivating her page. She stated that Thomas ""cupped his hand around my butt and pulled me pretty close to him"" and later ""squeezed"" her behind. Smith's former roommates and fellow Truman scholars confirmed that she had described the incident at the time. Thomas has denied the allegations. This comes years after Thomas' confirmation hearings were marred by accusations of sexual harassment from Anita Hill.

The Transportation Department has released data on discrimination complaints filed against airlines, showing a 37% increase in such complaints this year. The move comes in response to concerns about discriminatory treatment by airlines, particularly incidents involving Muslims. The data revealed that 52 complaints were based on race, 8 on national origin, 1 on color, 2 on religion, and 4 on sex discrimination. In September, the department received 6 discrimination complaints, down from the previous year. Additionally, the report showed a decrease in complaints regarding the treatment of disabled passengers. The report also included information on airlines' on-time performance, flight delays, baggage handling, and incidents involving animals.

His cattle have become semi-feral and roam over a large area near the Nevada, Utah, Arizona border. Bundy does not vaccinate or treat his cattle for disease, does not control breeding, and rarely brands them. The cattle are now reported to be slowly starving, although there is no official confirmation. The State of Nevada has not taken action to round up the cattle due to logistical difficulties and threats from Bundy supporters. Removing the cattle will be expensive and potentially dangerous, as they are near feral and aggressive. The value of the herd will also decline in the hot Nevada summer.

Microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by malformed heads and stunted brain development, has been linked to the Zika virus. The severity of microcephaly can vary, but it often results in mental impairment. Detecting the condition before birth is difficult, leading to debates about abortion. Raising a child with microcephaly requires extensive care and support, which can be costly. Early intervention programs can help, but they often end after three years. The CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics have published guidelines for evaluating and caring for infants with Zika-related microcephaly. The cost of care for each child is estimated to be $10 million over a lifetime. Families with resources, like the Grounds family, can provide the best care for their child, but many others struggle. Nicholas, a child with microcephaly, has made progress with intensive intervention, but ongoing support is necessary. Parents of children with microcephaly need support throughout their lives. Genetic testing revealed that Nicholas inherited two mutated genes from his parents, causing microcephaly. The odds of their second child having the condition were one in four.

The text discusses how Donald Trump was able to give a voice to the pain and anger of millions of Americans who felt ignored and dismissed by the political elite. These individuals had been poorly educated and lacked the words to express their feelings and experiences. Trump appealed to their fears and frustrations, promising to restore their world and make America great again. The text also highlights the long-standing anger and despair that has been building for decades due to job loss and economic changes. The media and policymakers often use clinical terms to describe the struggles faced by these workers, while corporations prioritize profits over human decency. Trump's supporters accepted his controversial actions because they felt he understood their perspective.

The debate in South Africa revolves around whether bike lanes are racist and classist. The lack of bike lanes in Johannesburg has led to dangerous conditions for cyclists, with many fatalities. The new mayor, Herman Mashaba, halted the construction of new bike lanes due to the cost and prioritization of basic services for the poor. Opponents argue that bike lanes symbolize a city that is not designed for everyone, while proponents see them as a way to address historical inequalities and create a more livable city. However, the implementation of bike lanes has been problematic, with misuse by taxis and cars parking in them. The issue became a political target, with bike lanes being criticized as a symbol of decadence and out-of-touch thinking. Despite the controversy, some cyclists, like Dan Khumalo, appreciate the presence of bike lanes as it makes their commutes safer.

"The suicides of two French girls who were bullied at school have sparked a debate about how to better protect teenagers. The story of Emilie, who took her own life in January, and the dramatization of Marion Fraisse's story, who died three years ago, have shed light on the issue of bullying in France. The film adaptation of Marion's story, titled ""Marion, 13 ans pour toujours - Marion, Forever 13,"" portrays the gradual descent of a young girl into depression and suicide. The film has prompted a discussion on social media, with many sharing their own experiences of bullying. France has attempted to address the problem with an anti-bullying law and a hotline for reporting incidents, but activists argue that more needs to be done. The issue of bullying extends beyond the school gates, with cyber-bullying also being a concern. Parents, teachers, and students are encouraged to openly discuss the problem to find a solution. Emilie's story, published in her diary, highlights the emotional and physical abuse she endured at school. A report by Unicef states that bullying is a global issue with severe negative effects on children's mental health. The recent attention on these tragic cases may lead to a change in how bullying is addressed in France."

"Leonard Cohen, the renowned songwriter and poet, died in his sleep after a fall in his Los Angeles home. His death was sudden and unexpected. Cohen, known for his religious imagery and themes of redemption and desire, was buried in Montreal next to his parents. He was born into a Jewish family and moved to New York in 1966 to pursue a career in music. Although he influenced many musicians and received numerous honors, Cohen rarely achieved mainstream success. His most famous song, ""Hallelujah,"" has been covered by countless artists. Cohen's work explored religion, love, politics, and the search for balance in life."

A federal report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has concluded that the barrier separating humans and primates at the Cincinnati Zoo was not in compliance with standards for housing primates when a child fell into the gorilla exhibit in May. The report issued a critical citation because the barrier failed and caused harm to an animal. However, before the incident, the zoo had not been cited for shortcomings with the barrier during previous inspections. The zoo has since updated the barrier and is now in compliance with federal standards. The family of the child who entered the enclosure has stated that they do not want to pursue legal action against the zoo. The USDA has issued 10 citations at the zoo in the last three years, but none were related to the gorilla exhibit. The Cincinnati Zoo officials have reaffirmed their commitment to the well-being of the animals and the safety of visitors. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) has stated that the zoo meets their standards related to barriers.

The focus now is on how many down-ballot Republicans Trump will drag down with him. Republican operatives and conservative radio hosts have declared that Trump is done and there is little he can do to turn it around. Trump's deficits in national and swing state polls are unprecedented, and his ground game is weak compared to Clinton's. Early voting numbers in Arizona and the shrinking advantage of Republicans in Florida and North Carolina indicate a potential win for Clinton. However, Democrats are not taking the outcome for granted and are working hard to mobilize voters. Trump's refusal to accept the voting results and his controversial remarks have galvanized Clinton's supporters. Trump's blaming of a globalist conspiracy and claims of a rigged election have raised concerns about the integrity of the election system. Trump's downward spiral has also affected House Republicans and vulnerable Senate candidates. Overall, Republicans are scared and the race has become a ""horror show"" for them."

BP has reported a leak of about 95 tonnes of oil into the North Sea from its Clair platform. The spill is smaller than previous incidents in the area and is being monitored from the air. The leak was caused by a technical issue with a system designed to separate production fluids. BP believes allowing the oil to disperse naturally at sea is the best approach. Experts are assessing the potential impact on the environment, particularly on seabird species. A full report and monitoring of the situation are requested.

The study shows that heightened temperatures and increased aridity since 1984 have caused fires to spread across an additional 16,000 square miles, an area larger than Massachusetts and Connecticut combined. The authors warn that further warming will exponentially increase fire activity in the coming decades. The study also highlights the role of climate change in exacerbating the recent California drought and the rise in fire incidents. Factors such as a natural climate oscillation and firefighting practices have also contributed to the increase in fires. The researchers emphasize the need to prepare for larger fire years due to climate change.

Wildfires near the Georgia-North Carolina line have led to evacuations and the need for residents to wear masks outdoors. The largest wildfire has burned over 13,000 acres and is only 20% contained. Special health masks are being distributed in North Carolina as regular surgical masks do not provide enough protection from smoke particles. Despite the smoke, the Charlotte Marathon was able to proceed as planned. Many of the wildfires are suspected arsons, with a dark blue SUV being sought in one case. In Tennessee, 72% of active wildfires are suspected arsons. In North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, over 20 wildfires are being investigated for suspected arson. The federal government has approved funding to fight the fires in western North Carolina. In South Carolina, residents are being asked to donate drinks to help firefighters battling a wildfire.

The opposition has been pushing for a recall referendum to remove Maduro from power, but the government has been delaying and suspending the process. Venezuelans have taken to the streets in protest, but security forces and government sympathizers have responded violently. The military and paramilitary groups continue to support Maduro, but there are signs of cultural differences and potential divisions within the military. The opposition is calling for dialogue and negotiations, but many see it as a stalling tactic. The situation in Venezuela is uncertain and the future remains unclear.

A judge declared a mistrial in the case of a white former police officer charged with murder in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black motorist during a traffic stop. The jury was deadlocked, with some leaning towards a conviction of voluntary manslaughter. The officer, Ray Tensing, shot Sam DuBose in the head after pulling him over for a missing license plate. Tensing testified that he feared for his life, but prosecutors argued that the evidence contradicted his story. The judge set a new hearing date to determine if the case will be retried. The DuBose family wants another trial and is disappointed with the jury's inability to reach a conclusion. The shooting has raised attention to how police deal with blacks. Legal experts say juries tend to give police officers the benefit of the doubt, but will convict if the actions were clearly unwarranted. The trial was conducted under heightened security due to the potential for unrest. The University of Cincinnati fired Tensing and reached a settlement with DuBose's family.

Definitely give this article a read if you are into environmental stuff."	Climate change has had a broad impact on ecosystems, with evidence of its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. A study identified 94 core ecological processes, of which 82% showed evidence of impact from climate change. These impacts range from shifts in species ranges and changes in phenology to disruptions at the genetic and ecosystem levels. Species are adapting to temperature extremes, with changes in physiology and morphology. Changes in phenology, abundance, and distribution of species have also been observed. These impacts have implications for food security, as reduced genetic diversity, inconsistent crop yields, and decreased productivity in fisheries threaten resources. Changes in disease vectors and the emergence of novel pathogens and pests pose a direct threat to human health and resources. Understanding these impacts is crucial for adapting to and mitigating the influence of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

However, they will fail to understand that it's only a random amplification of the effects that we a directly responsible for by spewing so much CO2 in to the atmosphere. We won't get them to act until people are literally dying in the street."	"The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has reported that levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have surpassed an important threshold and are unlikely to dip below it for ""many generations"". The 400 parts per million benchmark was broken globally for the first time in recorded history in 2015, and 2016 is expected to be the first full year to exceed this mark. The increase in CO2 levels can be attributed to a strong El Niño event, which caused drought conditions in tropical regions, reducing the ability of vegetation to absorb CO2. Additionally, there were extra emissions from fires sparked by the drier conditions. The WMO emphasizes the need to focus on cutting CO2 emissions in order to tackle climate change and keep temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius."

Goldfish that are released into the wild can become invasive and cause serious ecological damage. In Australia's Vasse River, goldfish have thrived and grown to large sizes, with some reaching 16 inches and four pounds. Goldfish invasions have also been reported in other places like Nevada, Colorado, and Alberta. The growth rate of goldfish in the Vasse River is the fastest known in the world. The problem with goldfish invasions stems from a disconnect between how people view goldfish as cute pets and their behavior in the wild. Goldfish are capable of rapid reproduction, uprooting vegetation, disturbing sediment, and transmitting diseases and parasites. Eradicating goldfish is difficult once they are established. Recent research has shown that goldfish are long-distance swimmers and migrate to spawn. Understanding goldfish behavior can help inform management strategies. It is crucial for pet owners to responsibly dispose of unwanted fish to prevent further invasions. Flushing fish down the toilet is not recommended.

"The author criticizes the Republican Party for not defending women against Donald Trump's sexist remarks and behavior. She questions why GOP leaders did not stand up for women after they had defended the party against accusations of sexism for years. The author suggests that the party prioritized appealing to certain voters over appealing to women. She argues that Trump's comments were not just ""locker room talk"" but a confession of assault. The author highlights how the Republican Party ignored Trump's chauvinism and even used their influence to force Republicans to support him. She believes that the GOP will suffer in the election and calls for the political obituaries of Trump's defenders. The author concludes by stating that she will not vote for Trump and warns that the GOP will lose the women's vote if they do not defend them."

Four people were killed in a river ride malfunction at Dreamworld, Australia's largest theme park. The incident occurred on the Thunder River Rapids Ride, a popular attraction that is considered tame and family-friendly. Two people were ejected from the raft, while the other two were trapped inside. The victims' identities have not been released, and authorities have not provided details about the injuries sustained. Witnesses reported seeing the ride flip and a girl being pulled from it before it overturned. Emergency services were unable to save the victims, and the park was closed for the day. The incident has deeply affected the staff and prompted an investigation by multiple agencies.

"Typhoon Meranti has caused damage in Taiwan and southeastern China, resulting in two deaths and dozens of injuries. The storm knocked out power and water supplies in both countries, with millions of homes affected. In addition, the storm caused the collapse of an 800-year-old bridge in China. Meanwhile, across the US, trees are dying at an alarming rate due to climate change, drought, disease, insects, and wildfires. California has lost 66 million trees since 2010, primarily due to drought and pine beetles. The spread of ""Sudden Oak Death"" is also infecting various plants in northern California. The presence of dead trees poses a significant fire hazard. Furthermore, a study has found that household dust exposes people to toxic chemicals, with phthalates being the most commonly found. This exposure can lead to serious health problems, especially in children."

Three U.S. military trainers were killed in Jordan when their vehicle failed to stop at the gate of a military base and security forces opened fire. The incident occurred at the King Faisal Air Base, and the cause is currently under investigation. Jordan is a close ally of the United States and is part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria. The U.S. Embassy in Amman stated that they are in contact with Jordanian authorities and do not believe the incident was terrorism-related. The King Faisal base is used for joint exercises and training Western-backed Syrian rebels. There are over 1,000 U.S. military personnel based in Jordan, primarily serving as advisers. Jordan's military has been on high alert since a deadly attack in June 2016.

The report also reveals a rise in hate crimes against Jewish, black, and LGBTQ individuals. These figures have been linked to President-elect Donald Trump's anti-minority rhetoric, which has fueled public anger and aggression. Experts believe that the actual number of hate crimes is likely higher than reported, and they expect the situation to worsen due to the mainstreaming of Islamophobia by Trump.

The unrest, which began last year, has led to attacks on industrial farms and factories, particularly those with state ties or owned by foreigners. Ethiopia's industrialization program and economic growth are at risk as current investors reconsider their options and new ones shy away. The government declared a state of emergency in response to the violence, leading to concerns from international organizations. The government has promised to help investors recoup their losses, but the future remains uncertain. Many investors are waiting to see if the government can address the underlying issues causing the unrest.

The Pilcomayo River in Paraguay is experiencing an extensive die-off of caiman, fish, and other river creatures due to a combination of drought and mismanagement. Up to 98% of caimans and 80% of capybaras are suspected dead. The river has dried up for nearly 435 miles and the government has declared an environmental emergency. The mismanagement of water resources and infrastructure by both Paraguay and Argentina has exacerbated the crisis. The river's wandering behavior and the significant amount of sediment it transports downstream have contributed to the blockage and dispersal of the river outside its channel. The government is working to find a solution, but there is no water to release or divert. Zimbabwe plans to sell its wildlife, including elephants and possibly endangered African wild dogs, to replenish its coffers due to cash shortages and a drought. Critics argue that the mismanagement of the economy and lack of accountability make this plan unworkable. South Australia has been hit by a destructive storm just 24 hours after a super cell thunderstorm knocked out the state's entire power network. The storm caused heavy rain, flooding, and major damage, and left thousands without power. The state is still recovering from the previous storm and is facing challenges in restoring power and dealing with the aftermath.

This contradicts the belief that increased criticism of police, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, has led to a ""war on cops."" However, the president of the national Fraternal Order of Police disagrees with the data and believes that officer deaths are increasing. The FBI data also reveal that instances of officers being killed in unprovoked or ambush attacks have remained steady for the past four years. The reasons for the decrease in officer deaths are unclear, but better training and policies are among the possible factors."

A mass grave containing the bodies of hundreds of Iraqi policemen who were executed by ISIS has been discovered near Mosul. The grave was found by Iraqi security forces during their assault on the ISIS stronghold. The bodies are believed to have been buried as recently as October, just before the US-backed forces began their assault on Mosul. The grave was visited by Human Rights Watch, who found four exposed corpses and piles of rubbish covering other bodies. Witnesses reported that ISIS rounded up around 2,000 people from the area and forced them to head towards Mosul, separating the former policemen and driving them away. Gunfire and screams were heard on multiple occasions, indicating further executions. Human Rights Watch has called for ISIS to be held accountable for these crimes against humanity.

Many Obama voters flipped to Trump, and he outperformed Romney among union households, whites without a college degree, and low-income households. The success of Obama's coalition may have been due to his unique talent as a politician, rather than a stable majority. The Democratic Party is now facing a struggle for dominance between Sanders supporters and the establishment wing. With no legislative victories in sight and upcoming electoral losses, the party's future is uncertain. Economic insecurity may have contributed to the rise of racism and far-right political parties. To prevent the views that led to Trump's victory, Democrats need to focus on delivering economic gains to working people.

Two soldiers were killed by attackers armed with guns, knives, and spears. In retaliation, the government used helicopters to fire at the attackers. The area is closed to Western journalists, making it difficult to verify the scale of the fighting. The Rohingya have been under siege since the government sent security forces to hunt for armed Rohingya assailants who had killed nine police officers. Human rights groups have received reports of killings, rapes, and beatings of Rohingya civilians. Western diplomats have called for an independent investigation into the violence, but Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has declined. The Rohingya population has been subjected to decades of repression, making them susceptible to radicalization. The government's harsh proposals may have been the catalyst for the recent attacks. The Rohingya villages have become armed camps, with reports of food scarcity, curfews, and rape by soldiers. Myanmar officials deny the occurrence of rapes.

The text highlights the ongoing disaster in Haiti caused by Hurricane Matthew, which has received little media coverage compared to previous disasters. The hurricane has caused significant material damage, including the destruction of houses, crops, and trees, as well as a spike in cholera cases. The lack of urgency and support from the central government and international agencies has frustrated local officials and community organizations. The slow response has led to desperation among the affected population, with some resorting to looting. The centralization of resources in Port-au-Prince and limited aid funds have contributed to the dire situation. The priority now is to support farmers in the affected regions to recover and rebuild their livelihoods. The Lambi Fund of Haiti is working with partner organizations to clean canals, clear fields, and provide local seeds for planting. The text emphasizes the need for awareness and support from the international community to help Haiti achieve food sovereignty and recover from the disaster.

You know my position when it comes to Trump, you know I dislike the man and all; however, I do not believe a teacher can use his position to bash someone especially on school grounds. I believe he can state his opinion, but not disguise it as the truth.

A history teacher in California was placed on leave after comparing President-elect Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. The teacher, Frank Navarro, who has taught at Mountain View High School for 40 years and is an expert on the Holocaust, was asked to leave after a parent complained about the lesson. Navarro claims that his lesson was based on facts and not opinion, and he feels that his free speech is being suppressed. The incident occurred amidst the controversy surrounding Trump's election victory over Hillary Clinton. Navarro had previously received complaints about his one-sided lessons, but he insists that his plan was based on facts. A petition to bring Navarro back has garnered over 1,000 signatures.

It's good thing to know that it has a medical term and is not sometihng actually paranormal.	Sleep paralysis is a common sleep problem that affects around 8% of the population. It occurs when a person is awake and conscious but unable to move, except for their eyes. Sleep paralysis often involves nightmares or hallucinations and can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The causes of sleep paralysis are not fully understood, but stress and disruptions to sleep, such as alcohol or caffeine, can increase the risk. It can also be a symptom of other sleep disorders and mental health conditions. Kendall Jenner discussed her struggles with sleep paralysis, which may be linked to her anxiety and jet lag. Sleep paralysis is more common in people with mental health problems and young adults. For most people, it is not a chronic condition, but some individuals experience recurrent episodes. Practicing good sleep behaviors, such as avoiding alcohol and caffeine and sleeping on your side, can help prevent sleep paralysis. If it becomes a problem, a specialist may be able to prescribe medications to suppress REM sleep and alleviate symptoms.

Three soldiers from Qatar have been killed while participating in Saudi-led military operations in Yemen. This is the largest loss of life for Qatar in the conflict since their first reported ground deployment in September. The soldiers were identified as Mohammed Awad Salim, Mohammed Dawood Khayal, and Mohammed Nasser Mohammed. The conflict in Yemen involves the internationally recognized government and the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels and forces loyal to a former president. The coalition has been conducting airstrikes since March 2015.

"A black church in Greenville, Mississippi, was set on fire and vandalized with the words ""Vote Trump"" spray painted on the side. The fire is being investigated as a hate crime, and federal authorities are assisting with the investigation. The mayor of Greenville sees this as an attack on the black church and community. The city has experienced previous acts of racism, including the word ""nigger"" being painted on a boat. Arson is difficult to prove, but in this case, the political graffiti suggests a motive. Black churches have historically been targeted in acts of intimidation and hatred. With the upcoming election, there are concerns about violence and voter intimidation. The burning of the church is a reflection of the tense political climate in the United States."

An infant orangutan named Dina was confiscated from an illegal trader and taken to the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme (SOCP) for care. Within 24 hours, Dina collapsed and was diagnosed with meningitis, leaving her paralyzed and blind. She is currently receiving intensive care and treatment, but her future is uncertain. The SOCP's mission is to protect and conserve the critically endangered Sumatran orangutan through various efforts. They aim to provide the highest level of care for orangutans like Dina and rely on support to continue their work.

They could sue the developers, but no amount of money is going to compensate them for the health issues these kids are going to experience due to lead poisoning. The worst thing about this is, if it were a wealthy white neighbourhood adjacent to the industrial site they wanted to demolish, you know they would have taken every precaution to test to see if there was any chance of releasing toxic amounts of lead into the vicinity.

But it's a poor black neighbourhood, so of course they aren't as careful.	Lead contamination in a housing project in South Los Angeles is putting 300 children at risk of lead poisoning. Elevated blood lead levels have been recorded in the children, with some levels well above the CDC threshold. The former industrial site near the housing project has been found to have elevated lead and arsenic levels. The proposed lowering of the lead detection level for federal cleanup action could affect millions of subsidized and public housing units. The site has been cleaned up, but residents are concerned about the impact of planned demolition. Lead levels have also been found in nearby schools, but authorities claim they are not a risk to human health. The housing project also faces other pollution issues, including a trichloroethylene plume in the groundwater and a breach in an underground oil pipeline. Soil tests conducted by a nonprofit organization found that over 50% of the samples taken exceeded the cleanup threshold. The situation has been described as a case of environmental racism.

Two American sisters, Robin Korkki and Anne Korkki, were found unresponsive in their resort in the Seychelles and later pronounced dead. Autopsies revealed that they died from acute pulmonary edema, or excess fluid in the lungs, with Anne also having excess fluid in the brain. The cause of the fluid buildup is still unknown, and toxicology analysis is being conducted. No visible injuries were found on the bodies. The sisters' family is seeking answers and some members have traveled to the Seychelles to gather details and bring the bodies home. The Seychelles is a popular tourist destination known for its beaches and coral reefs. The sisters arrived on September 15 and were scheduled to leave on September 24.

It's sad that there are still outbreaks of cholera and other diseases that are easily preventable with sanitation and access to clean drinking water. If we all pitch in just a couple dollars, the cost of buying a bottle of water, I bet we could make a significant contribution to the relief effort in Yemen.	The number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen has risen to 1,410 within three weeks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The outbreak was declared on October 6, and by October 10, there were 24 suspected cases. However, as of Thursday, there were 1,410 suspected cases in 10 out of Yemen's 23 governorates. The conflict between a Saudi Arabia-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi group has destroyed much of Yemen's infrastructure, making it difficult to control the disease outbreak. Cholera is just one of the risks in Yemen's war, which has left millions displaced and in need of medical help. Only 47 of the suspected cases have tested positive for cholera, and the outbreak has spread beyond the capital to nine other governorates. Children under 10 account for half of the cases, with six deaths from cholera and 36 associated deaths from acute watery diarrhea. Prompt treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics is crucial in severe cases.

I think that our country should continue to report on these terrible conditions and try to get aid to Haiti from every source available.	A month after Hurricane Matthew hit southwestern Haiti, the region is facing widespread hunger and destruction. At least 800,000 people urgently need food, but there is not enough aid reaching the affected areas. Truckloads of food and medical supplies have been looted, and desperate crowds have clashed with police. The storm destroyed homes, crops, and livestock, leaving many without shelter or a means to survive. Cholera outbreaks are also occurring due to contaminated water supplies. The United Nations has only raised one-third of the emergency funding needed to help the affected population. The Haitian government, along with international relief organizations, is coordinating efforts to provide assistance, but political obstacles and the upcoming elections pose challenges. The situation is dire, with people sleeping under trees and lacking basic necessities. The destruction is so severe that some remote mountain villages may not receive aid until the end of November.

Children growing up drinking this polluted water can have many health problems including learning disabilities, behavioral problems and a variety of diseases.   The homeless are also prone to having problems because they rely on public drinking fountains every day.	Chicago has shut down hundreds of public drinking fountains due to excessive levels of lead in the water. The ongoing crisis in Flint, Michigan has prompted other communities to test for lead, including the Chicago Park District. Testing revealed that nearly a quarter of outdoor fountains and 14 indoor fountains and sinks exceeded the federal standard for lead levels. Some fountains had lead levels 80 times higher than the permissible level. All fountains and sinks with high lead levels have been disabled and will undergo further testing and repairs. The lack of adequate testing for lead in public settings is a national problem, according to public health officials. Lead can have serious health effects, especially in young children, and there is no safe level of lead in the body. Lead pipes and fixtures are still common in communities across the country. While taking a sip from a single fountain may not seriously affect health, it can contribute to cumulative lead exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations like the homeless and children.

Islamic State militants in Iraq are kidnapping thousands of villagers and using them as human shields as they retreat towards Mosul. Those who refuse to comply are shot, while others are taken but manage to escape. The militants are also executing former policemen and army officers out of paranoia.

The militants have also set fire to oil wells and a sulfur plant, causing noxious fumes. As Iraqi forces advance towards Mosul, the militants are expected to put up a tough fight.

I learned that they have a form of punishment there and it is called ""four-pointing"".  They cuff each limb to the corner of a concrete slab or bed frame.  That just sounds like torture to me.  The guy that the story is about is serving a 35-year sentence for drug trafficking and assaulting a corrections officer.  This prison is known as the toughest prison and I can see why.  You really should read this article, it is very eye opening."	Inmates at Lewisburg federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania are forced to live with violent cellmates or be placed in restraints. Inmates have no say in who they share a cell with, even if the cellmate has a violent history or severe mental illness. If they refuse a cellmate, they are placed in restraints for hours or days. Restraints are also used as punishment for inmates who break rules or get into fights. The conditions in the Special Management Unit (SMU) at Lewisburg are harsh, with inmates spending nearly 24 hours a day in small cells with little room to move. In 2014 and 2015, there were 228 in-cell fights and assaults at Lewisburg, resulting in injuries and even deaths. The use of restraints at Lewisburg has been criticized by inmates, lawyers, and auditors, but the Bureau of Prisons denies any mistreatment. Changes have been made to the SMU, but the use of restraints remains unchanged. Inmates are left with few options: accept a violent cellmate or be restrained.
156	6.2	5.875	Hey B, remember that conversation we had the other day, well I found an article that talks about it.  It basically says that humans have destroyed 10 percent of Earth's wilderness in the last 25 years.  The article said that the total land area is about half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of the whole state of Alaska.  That is about 1.3 million square miles of wilderness, that just disappeared.  The article also revealed that humanity has one to two decades more to turn it around before it is too late.  I hope something is done soon and I'll send you a link to the article.	sadness	2	2	1	32	50000	7.0	6.5	1.0	7.0	4.5	4.428999999999999	4.143	4.428999999999999	5.0	199	I am a 32-year-old female of the White race.

I hope something is done soon and I'll send you a link to the article.	A study has found that humans have destroyed about 10 percent of Earth's wilderness since 1992, equivalent to an area half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of Alaska. The research team from Australia's University of Queensland defines wilderness as an area with no human development. The destruction is primarily due to activities such as logging, agriculture, mining, and oil and gas exploration. The study aims to raise awareness and calls for international policies to protect remaining wilderness areas. The loss of wilderness is particularly significant in South America, which has experienced a 30 percent decline. The researchers warn that once wilderness is gone, it cannot be restored, emphasizing the need to protect what is left. The report criticizes the United Nations and others for ignoring the problem and highlights the urgency of taking action to prevent further loss.

A mass grave containing bodies showing evidence of torture by the Islamic State (ISIS) was discovered near Mosul, Iraq. The exact number of bodies and cause of death is unknown, but investigators believe that many more burial sites will be found as Iraqi forces continue to retake territory from ISIS. The bodies found in this grave had been dumped on piles of trash, with some showing signs of being bound and blindfolded. Locals reported that ISIS fighters had been rounding up former members of Iraqi security forces in the area. A UN human rights organization stated that ISIS recently abducted 295 former Iraqi security forces members and forced 1,500 families to retreat with them to the Mosul airport, potentially using them as human shields.

Police in Hope, Indiana, shared a disturbing photo of a mother passed out in her car from a drug overdose, with her 10-month-old son crying in the backseat. The incident highlights a growing trend of parents using drugs with their children in the car to avoid disapproval. The mother was revived with Narcan and charged with child neglect and possession of drug paraphernalia. The child now lives with his grandmother. This case is similar to a previous incident in East Liverpool, Ohio, where a couple overdosed with their 4-year-old son in the car. The police hope that sharing these photos will discourage drug users from endangering children. The opioid crisis continues to claim the lives of about 78 Americans every day.

A study suggests that legalizing the ivory trade would lead to the extinction of elephants, as the demand for ivory far exceeds what can be sustainably harvested. The researchers argue that even in the best-protected elephant populations, it is not possible to harvest enough ivory without driving the elephants to extinction. The demand for ivory in Asia results in the killing of around 27,000 elephants each year. The study emphasizes the need to focus on reducing demand for ivory in order to save elephants from extinction. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of accurately determining the amount of ivory within each country's borders to set sustainable quotas. The Kenya government recently destroyed over 100 tons of elephant ivory in an effort to combat the illegal ivory trade.

A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals that 90% of seabirds currently eat plastic in the ocean, and by 2050, virtually all seabirds will be consuming it. The research explains that seabirds rely on their sense of smell to hunt for food, and the scent emitted by plastic in the ocean tricks them into confusing it with food. The study also found that birds that track the scent of a sulfurous compound emitted by algae, which coats floating plastic, are six times more likely to consume plastic. The research sheds light on species that are often overlooked, such as petrels and shearwaters, which are impacted by plastic ingestion. The study highlights the need to address the growing plastic pollution in oceans, which affects not only seabirds but also sea turtles, fish, and other marine animals. The problem of plastic pollution starts on land, with nonpoint source pollution being one of the biggest contributors. The top five countries that dump plastics into oceans are China, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand.

As Iraqi forces continue to push into Mosul, civilian casualties are increasing. The battle against the Islamic State has resulted in soldiers and civilians being injured or killed by chlorine gas, mortar fire, bombs, and artillery shells. The presence of civilians in the city has made the fight more difficult for Iraqi forces and airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition. The Islamic State has been using civilians as human shields, preventing them from leaving the city. The medical station on the outskirts of Mosul is treating injured civilians, but many are unable to reach medical assistance. The fight for Mosul is expected to be prolonged, putting more civilians at risk. The Iraqi military does not release overall casualty figures, but the toll is likely much higher than reported. The battle has also caused food shortages, forcing some residents to flee. The situation is dire, with injured children and desperate pleas for help.

The families of 43 missing Mexican college students are leading a march in Mexico City to demand their return on the second anniversary of their disappearance. The students were intercepted by local police and handed over to a drug cartel while hijacking buses in 2014.

One father believes his son and the others are still alive and that the families will never trust the government.

The North Carolina Republican Party has condemned the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) for planning a parade to honor President-elect Donald Trump's victory. The KKK's official newspaper had previously expressed support for Trump. The Trump campaign quickly denounced the parade and reiterated their disavowal of hate groups. This is not the first time Trump has faced criticism for his response to white supremacists, as he was hesitant to disavow support from former KKK leader David Duke during the campaign.

A new study conducted in California has found that lung cancer patients exposed to air pollution may have shorter survival times. The research focused on California due to its wide range of air pollution levels and extensive air quality monitoring network. The study found that patients in areas with high levels of fine particulate matter had a median survival time of only 2.4 years, compared to 5.7 years in areas with lower pollution levels. Lung cancer patients whose cancer had spread to other parts of their bodies had shorter survival times overall, regardless of air pollution levels. The researchers suggest that newly diagnosed lung cancer patients should consider moving out of areas with high levels of air pollution. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in America, according to the CDC.

A gas shortage in the Southeastern United States has caused long lines at gas stations and limited availability of fuel. The shortage was caused by a leak in a pipeline that runs from Houston to New Jersey, resulting in over 300,000 gallons of gas being leaked. The states affected by the shortage include Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas. While prices have increased, they are still below $2.50 per gallon in many areas. The shortage has led to panic and frustration among drivers, with some gas stations completely running out of fuel. Efforts are being made to address the shortage, including repairs to the pipeline and alternative methods of transporting gasoline.

Over 3,800 people have died, averaging about 90 deaths per week. The largest migration of refugees since World War II is currently taking place, with over 65 million people displaced from their homes. Despite fewer people crossing this year compared to 2015, the death toll has increased. The main routes across the Mediterranean are from Turkey to Greece, Libya to Italy, and West Africa to Spain. Syria produces the most refugees, with nearly five million fleeing the country due to civil war. The war in Syria has also resulted in an estimated 430,000 deaths. While some refugees are resettled in countries like the United States and Canada, the majority seek asylum in Europe or remain in the Middle East. With no end to the war in sight, the refugee crisis and the loss of lives will continue.

"France's President Francois Hollande has announced plans to completely shut down the migrant camp known as ""the Jungle"" in Calais. He has called on London to help deal with the thousands of people living in squalor in the camp, whose ultimate goal is to reach Britain. France intends to relocate the migrants in small groups around the country, but right-wing opponents accuse Hollande of mismanaging a problem that they believe is Britain's responsibility. Hollande reminded Britain that if France stopped preventing migrants from entering Britain, it would be obliged to deal with the matter when asylum-seekers arrive on its shores. He expects London to honor agreements on managing the flow of migrants."

Islamic State militants in Iraq are kidnapping thousands of villagers and using them as human shields as they retreat towards Mosul. Those who refuse to comply are shot, while others are taken but manage to escape. The militants are also executing former policemen and army officers out of paranoia. This tactic of holding civilians hostage complicates the U.S.-led airstrikes and puts civilians at risk of being caught in crossfire. The militants have also set fire to oil wells and a sulfur plant, causing noxious fumes. As Iraqi forces advance towards Mosul, the militants are expected to put up a tough fight.

Jewish communities in the United States are grappling with fear, grief, and anger following Donald Trump's election as president. Synagogues across the country have held prayer and healing services to address these emotions. While Jews have not been directly insulted by Trump, they fear that his presidency will create a hostile environment for minority groups. The Jewish community is overwhelmingly liberal and Democratic, leading to a sense of alienation from their fellow Americans. However, they also recognize the need for understanding and reaching out to Trump supporters. Jews are urged to reflect on their own actions and allyship with other marginalized groups. This new era has brought about a struggle for Jews to understand Trump supporters while maintaining their own values and finding solidarity with others.

Millions of trees across the United States are dying due to a combination of factors including disease, insects, drought, and wildfires, all exacerbated by climate change. One example is the rapid ohi'a death disease in Hawaii, which has infected nearly 50,000 acres of native forest. The cause of this disease is still unknown, and scientists are struggling to find a treatment. In California, an invasive pathogen called Sudden Oak Death is killing millions of trees, including redwoods. Bark beetles and mountain pine beetles are also wreaking havoc on forests, expanding their range due to climate change. The loss of trees has far-reaching consequences, affecting clean water, carbon storage, and entire ecosystems. Scientists are working on genetic research to understand why some trees are able to survive these threats, but they warn that in a few decades, American forests may be unrecognizable.

The US presidential election has led to a surge in calls to crisis and suicide prevention hotlines. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline received a significant increase in calls, with the volume being two to three times higher than usual. The Crisis Text Line also experienced a surge in texts, with eight times the normal volume. The Trevor Project, which provides support to LGBTQ youth, saw a doubling of call volume, with more than 95% of callers discussing the election. The Trans Lifeline, which supports the transgender community, has been flooded with calls since the election, receiving more than 500 calls a day. The election results have caused panic and fear among callers, particularly regarding the potential loss of insurance and trans-affirming healthcare. These crisis hotlines are urging people to support each other, get back to routines, and limit exposure to media that exacerbates feelings of hopelessness. Acts of kindness and compassion are also encouraged to help alleviate anxiety.

"A man in Australia escaped with cuts to his leg after a shark collided with his surfboard near Byron Bay. The incident led to the closure of local beaches for 24 hours. The shark emerged from under the man while he was waiting for a wave, causing minor lacerations to his leg. The type of shark involved is unknown. This attack follows a similar incident in the same area a few weeks ago. The New South Wales coast has seen 14 unprovoked shark attacks in 2015, with a hotspot from Evans Head to Byron Bay. Efforts to control shark populations have been challenging, with a recent shark eco-barrier trial being canceled due to rough sea conditions. The government plans to increase tagging and relocation of sharks using ""smart drumlines"" to catch them. Shark attacks are on the rise due to the popularity of water sports and the movement of bait fish closer to shore, although fatalities are still rare."

So when can we expect polar bears to go extinct? Because you know by the time we get around to helping them, it'll be too late. The older, conservative generation just needs to go. Anyways, you should really read this article. I told you this was an issue that needed to be addressed, so go read it.	A new study from the University of Washington, funded by NASA and other agencies, reveals that all 19 polar bear populations across the Arctic are facing a shorter sea ice season. The study, which is the first to quantify the sea ice changes in each polar bear subpopulation, shows a trend towards earlier sea ice melt in the spring and later ice growth in the fall. These changes negatively impact the feeding and breeding capabilities of the bears, as they rely on the sea ice for essential activities such as hunting and traveling. The study also found that the critical timing of the sea ice break-up and freeze-up is changing in all areas, which is harmful for polar bears. The researchers recommend that the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance be incorporated as measures of climate change in future reports.

"The suicides of two French girls who were bullied at school have sparked a debate about how to better protect teenagers. The story of Emilie, who took her own life in January, and the dramatization of Marion Fraisse's story, who died three years ago, have shed light on the issue of bullying in France. The film adaptation of Marion's story, titled ""Marion, 13 ans pour toujours - Marion, Forever 13,"" portrays the gradual descent of a young girl into depression and suicide. The film has prompted a discussion on social media, with many sharing their own experiences of bullying. France has attempted to address the problem with an anti-bullying law and a hotline for reporting incidents, but activists argue that more needs to be done. The issue of bullying extends beyond the school gates, with cyber-bullying also being a concern. Parents, teachers, and students are encouraged to openly discuss the problem to find a solution. Emilie's story, published in her diary, highlights the emotional and physical abuse she endured at school. A report by Unicef states that bullying is a global issue with severe negative effects on children's mental health. The recent attention on these tragic cases may lead to a change in how bullying is addressed in France."

Leon Russell, a musician known for his dynamic performances, has died at the age of 74. He emerged in the 1970s as a prominent rock 'n' roll performer and songwriter after working as a studio pianist in the 1960s. Russell's health had been declining in recent years, and he had undergone surgery and suffered a heart attack. However, he had plans to return to the road in January. Russell's period of stardom was relatively short, but he experienced a comeback in 2010 when he collaborated with Elton John on an album. Russell recorded numerous albums and was also a successful songwriter for other artists. He was known for his unique image and energetic stage presence. Russell's last performance was in July 2016. He began his career as part of the Wrecking Crew, a group of studio musicians, and later became a star in his own right. Russell's collaboration with Elton John brought him back into the spotlight after a period of relative obscurity.

A new study conducted in California has found that lung cancer patients exposed to air pollution may have shorter survival times. The research focused on California due to its wide range of air pollution levels and extensive air quality monitoring network. The study found that patients in areas with high levels of fine particulate matter had a median survival time of only 2.4 years, compared to 5.7 years in areas with lower pollution levels. Lung cancer patients whose cancer had spread to other parts of their bodies had shorter survival times overall, regardless of air pollution levels. The researchers suggest that newly diagnosed lung cancer patients should consider moving out of areas with high levels of air pollution. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in America, according to the CDC.

This is going to sound insensitive, but this article was rather dry. And I just realized that that was a horrible pun. Anyways, this article is illustrating the harm of over pumping water sources in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It sounds like a really terrible situation, with arsenic being a terrible poison that's being pushed around by all of this negligence. You should read it.	Overpumping of groundwater in Dhaka, Bangladesh is causing a water crisis that extends beyond the city center. The pumping has caused groundwater levels to drop significantly over the past 50 years, leading to water quality and supply issues in surrounding peri-urban and rural communities. The presence of naturally occurring arsenic in shallow groundwater further exacerbates the problem. The pumping is causing faster groundwater flow, which can transport contaminants like arsenic to deeper areas of the aquifer, even outside the city limits. This poses a threat to deep wells used for arsenic mitigation in these areas. The researchers used detailed subsurface measurements to model the geology of Dhaka and found that strong pumping and heterogeneity in the underground sediments affect the hydrology of the area. Heterogeneity refers to the way sand and clay are oriented underground and is critical to how contaminants move in groundwater. In a delta system like Bangladesh, the clay layers are chopped up, allowing water to move in unpredictable ways and creating uncertainty about well contamination. The researchers theorize that if pumping continues at current levels, some wells outside the city center could become contaminated sooner than expected. The low water levels caused by pumping could also compromise the operation of handpumps in these areas. Arsenic is tasteless, odorless, and colorless, making it difficult for communities to detect its presence in water without testing. The researchers' models showed that typical hydrogeological data used to assess well safety is not predictive in this type of heterogeneous system. This highlights the need for water quality monitoring and the development of artificial groundwater recharge methods to address the water crisis in the region.

Garden ponds 'playing role' in frog disease spread — Garden ponds are playing a role in the spread of deadly frog diseases across the UK, a study suggests. Ranaviruses can infect amphibians, reptiles and fish. In the UK, they have devastated common frog populations. This research suggests that the introduction of infected animals from aquatic retailers into ponds or moving species between different ponds may be exacerbating the problem.	A study suggests that garden ponds are contributing to the spread of deadly frog diseases in the UK. Ranaviruses, which can infect amphibians, reptiles, and fish, have devastated common frog populations. The research indicates that infected animals from aquatic retailers or the movement of species between ponds may be worsening the problem. The virus appears to be spreading faster than frogs can hop, and human-aided dispersal is likely involved. Ranaviruses are a group of viruses found worldwide, and they can kill common frogs by causing sores and blisters on their skin or internal bleeding. Genetic records suggest that ranavirus was introduced to the UK on two separate occasions. Garden ponds can act as stepping stones for infected animals to reach new sites, and the transfer of frogspawn or frogs between ponds may be aiding the spread of the virus. The study emphasizes the need to manage the risk of disease outbreaks while still supporting wildlife by adding ponds to urban gardens. Limiting the movement of potentially-infectious material is strongly advised.

"Sally Brampton, the founding editor of Elle magazine in the UK, took her own life after health professionals failed to offer her help, according to an inquest. Brampton, who had a long battle with depression, drowned after walking into the sea near her home. She had sought help from a psychiatrist and GP but did not receive the assistance she needed. Two months prior to her death, she had been referred to mental health services but was not offered any help. The inquest revealed that crucial information about her condition had not been provided to the relevant services. The coroner concluded that there were missed opportunities to help Brampton, but it is uncertain if they would have changed the outcome. The mental health services have since made changes and no longer use faxes. Brampton was a respected journalist and author, known for her book ""Shoot the Damn Dog"" about her battle with depression."

Bayh has been attacked for his multiple homes, high earnings, and corporate ties. However, he still has a chance of winning, with recent polls showing a statistical tie between him and Young. Republicans are facing a cash crunch, with Bayh having a significant edge in ad spending. If Bayh wins, it would be a significant blow to GOP chances of holding their majority in the Senate. Bayh's entrance into the race was seen as a recruiting coup for the Democrats, and his bipartisan appeal has given him an advantage. Young's pitch is that Bayh has transformed from a centrist to a supporter of President Obama's agenda, using his positions to land post-Senate business. The attacks on Bayh's wealth resonate in Indiana, where the culture is parochial and politicians often emphasize their ""Hoosier"" identity. Bayh wants the race to focus on his accomplishments, such as the Evan Bayh 21st Century Scholars Program. However, the race has become increasingly negative, with outside groups playing a significant role."

The city has experienced previous acts of racism, including the word ""nigger"" being painted on a boat. Arson is difficult to prove, but in this case, the political graffiti suggests a motive. Black churches have historically been targeted in acts of intimidation and hatred. With the upcoming election, there are concerns about violence and voter intimidation. The burning of the church is a reflection of the tense political climate in the United States."

The families of 43 missing Mexican college students are leading a march in Mexico City to demand their return on the second anniversary of their disappearance. The students were intercepted by local police and handed over to a drug cartel while hijacking buses in 2014. The government initially claimed the students were killed and incinerated, but international experts and the families doubt this theory. One father believes his son and the others are still alive and that the families will never trust the government.

The video shows two women applying mascara and lipstick, and another woman whispers ""ugly to see"" before scolding them. Some people believe this is an excessive restriction on behavior, while others support the message. The rail company argues that the video is part of a series aimed at educating passengers on rules and etiquette. Other videos in the series focus on discouraging smartphone use while walking and carrying large bags on crowded trains. The top complaint by passengers using the trains is making loud noises."

The police arrived to find him unconscious and bleeding, but have yet to identify a suspect or determine the motive. The incident has sparked allegations of a hate crime, given the rise in anti-Muslim sentiment during the presidential race. Alnahdi was well-liked and had quickly become part of the community. Saudi students make up a significant portion of the international student body at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. There have been reports of anti-Muslim harassment in nearby areas, but the town's administrators and police claim to be unaware of any racial tensions or prejudice.

How disgusting.	The Chicago Police Department is facing a digital archive that documents two decades of torture by its officers. The archive, called the Chicago Torture Archive, contains over 10,000 documents related to cases of torture between 1972 and 1991. These cases involved over 100 black men who were tortured by police officers to force confessions or intimidate witnesses. The archive, which will be housed at the University of Chicago, includes interrogations, trial files, journalism works, and records of activism. The launch of the archive coincides with recent efforts in Chicago to address police misconduct, including the passing of the Reparations for Burge Torture Victims ordinance. The archive's director hopes that the lessons learned from these cases can inform and inspire young activists. While the archive provides a comprehensive resource for studying the cases, there are concerns about privacy and whether victims and their families were made aware of the archive's existence. Despite these concerns, the archive is seen as an essential tool for academics, researchers, and historians to understand this dark chapter in Chicago's history. It also presents an opportunity for the police department to mend relationships with residents and increase transparency and accountability.

The Somali community expressed fears of backlash and called for unity. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities are still investigating any potential links to foreign terrorist organizations. The off-duty police officer was praised for his heroic actions in ending the attack.

It would be a shame to lose these beautiful animals, just because of ivory.	At a global wildlife summit, a bid to provide the highest level of international legal protection to all African elephants was defeated. However, new measures were passed to add vital protection for elephants, including the closure of legal ivory markets within nations and tougher measures to deal with nations failing to control poached ivory. The debate over elephant poaching has divided African countries, with some arguing that making money from ivory sales and trophy hunting is necessary for protection, while others believe that poaching and the illegal ivory trade pose the greatest threat. Most African elephants already have the highest level of international legal protection, but elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Botswana have a lower level of protection. A proposal to upgrade these populations to the highest level of protection was defeated. The EU and some scientific and conservation groups opposed the upgrade, arguing that it did not meet the biological criteria. The issue of cutting the demand for ivory and better enforcement against poachers were highlighted as key solutions.

Gaskell was discovered covered in leeches and disoriented but is in stable condition with minor injuries. His friend described him as mentally strong, which likely helped him endure. Gaskell's family had difficulty contacting him due to poor mobile coverage in the hiking area.

"Multiple studies show that Trump's sexist rhetoric can have a significant impact on thinking, stress, and self-esteem. Women have expressed feeling gross and objectified by his comments, and even trauma victims have been distressed by his behavior. Trump's defense that his words are ""just words"" or ""locker room talk"" does not render them harmless, as rude language can impair cognition and lead to less creative thinking. Uncivil political discourse, especially in a presidential debate, undermines trust in government and discourages women from running for office. Discriminatory speech has negative consequences for women, leading to anger, depression, and lower self-esteem. Different types of discrimination can compound each other, with women of color experiencing even greater harm. Trump's candidacy exposes the bleak state of gender relations in the US and raises questions about how sexism will be taken seriously in the future."

The Obama administration has announced that it will resume deportations of undocumented Haitian immigrants due to a surge in Haitian migrants seeking to enter the United States. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, deportations were suspended, but they were partially resumed later on for those convicted of serious crimes or considered a threat to national security. However, since last spring, thousands of Haitian migrants who had moved to Brazil for work have been making their way to the United States. These migrants have been allowed to enter the country and given permission to stay for up to three years under a humanitarian parole provision. With the full resumption of deportations, Haitians without visas will now be put into expedited removal proceedings. The surge in Haitian migrants has overwhelmed shelters in Tijuana, and many migrants have chosen to sleep on the streets. The change in American policy has surprised advocates in San Diego and Tijuana, who object to the policy change that does not reflect any actual change in reality.

Management and ownership at a Saskatoon dog kennel were warned about multiple serious problems with their animal care methods before the death of 14 large breed dogs. The kennel was warned about ventilation problems, among other issues, by a certified master trainer and kennel care expert. The SPCA also received a copy of the complaints but is unable to pursue them due to lack of power. The dogs died of heat exhaustion after a malfunction in the building's heating system caused the room they were in to become excessively hot. The kennel manager expressed remorse and stated that the upper-floor room where the deaths occurred has been closed off. The kennel will remain open. The kennel had previously received positive reviews from customers, but the trainer who raised concerns said that customers don't see the full picture. The trainer quit after management refused his suggestions and took his list of concerns to the SPCA. The SPCA is part of a coalition urging the provincial Ministry of Agriculture to reform legislation to better protect animals.

Since October 17, ISIS has taken tens of thousands of men, women, and children from the outskirts of Mosul into the city, intending to use them as human shields. Iraqi forces have launched an operation to cut ISIS supply lines west of Mosul. Reports indicate that ISIS has abducted thousands of families from various areas. The use of human shields is a violation of international humanitarian law. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned ISIS's strategy and urged those fighting ISIS not to carry out revenge attacks. The Mosul operation has already displaced thousands of people, and camps have been set up to accommodate them. Civilians continue to flee despite the risks involved.

They gathered in Austurvollur square in Reykjavik, shouting ""Out"" to discrimination against women. The protest highlighted the 30% pay gap between men and women in Iceland. The demonstration aimed to bring attention to the issue and demand change. Despite Iceland's reputation as a gender-equal nation, progress on pay equity has been slow. The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap ranking shows that Iceland still has gaps in earned income and wages for similar work. The report also reveals that global progress towards economic parity between men and women has suffered setbacks in recent years. The gender pay gap persists due to various factors, including women entering less well-paid professions and the time it takes for employers' implicit gender biases to change. The protest in Iceland emphasizes the urgency of addressing the gender pay gap and the need for faster progress."

These guys have been around longer than we have, as a species. It's really sad to think that we would be responsible for endangering them even further than we already have.	New research suggests that habitat degradation poses a greater risk to the survival of turtles and tortoises than rising global temperatures. Over 60% of these species are listed as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered due to factors such as trading, collection for food and medicine, and habitat degradation. The study used climate models and the fossil record to investigate the impact of long-term climate change on these species. Results show that turtles and tortoises were able to withstand warmer climates in the past as long as there was enough water to support them. However, they are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, making climate change a significant threat to their conservation status.

I just finished reading an article about an endangered species in the Gulf called the Vaquita that is slated to be extinct by 2022 due to nothing beyond happening to be in the water where people are fishing. It's just so thoughtless, so shortsighted, and so frustratingly preventable.	The vaquita, the most endangered marine mammal on Earth, is facing extinction due to gill net fishing and the illegal trade of totoaba. Urgent conservation measures were approved to protect the vaquita, including a permanent ban on gill net fishing and efforts to crack down on the totoaba trade. However, experts argue that these measures are not enough to save the species. The current plan neglects local livelihoods, fails to involve local fishermen in designing a sustainable management plan, and does not adequately address the totoaba trade. The ban on gill nets is seen as a step forward, but more interventions are needed to ensure the vaquita's recovery. This case highlights the challenges and complexities of endangered species conservation. Conservation efforts often come too late or lack the thoroughness needed to make a lasting impact. A long-term vision and proactive action are necessary to effectively conserve species and natural resources.

I don't understand why people have such little regards for the well being of the elephant species, knowing that they are on the verge of extinction and it upsets me severerly knowing that we are taking them for granted.	A study suggests that legalizing the ivory trade would lead to the extinction of elephants, as the demand for ivory far exceeds what can be sustainably harvested. The researchers argue that even in the best-protected elephant populations, it is not possible to harvest enough ivory without driving the elephants to extinction. The demand for ivory in Asia results in the killing of around 27,000 elephants each year. The study emphasizes the need to focus on reducing demand for ivory in order to save elephants from extinction. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of accurately determining the amount of ivory within each country's borders to set sustainable quotas. The Kenya government recently destroyed over 100 tons of elephant ivory in an effort to combat the illegal ivory trade.

The Bramble Cay melomys, a reddish-brown rodent, recently made international news when it was declared extinct. While climate change played a role in its demise, human inaction was the ultimate cause. Rising sea levels due to climate change destroyed the melomys' habitat and food sources. However, it was revealed that Australian researchers had planned to start a captive breeding program for the melomys, but they were unable to find any individuals on Bramble Cay. This missed opportunity highlights the tragedy that had been unfolding for years. In a new paper, biologist John Woinarski and colleagues argue that the extinction of the melomys, along with two other Australian species, could have been prevented. The Christmas Island pipistrelle and Christmas Island forest skink also suffered from human neglect and inaction, allowing introduced predators to decimate their populations. Australia's biodiversity conservation law lacks explicit commitment to preventing human-caused extinctions, leaving species vulnerable. These extinctions are often overlooked due to the small size and remote locations of the species. Australia has the highest rate of mammal extinctions in the world, with 30 species lost since European colonization. Woinarski's assessment is driven by personal grief and a desire to learn from past mistakes. Australia still has over a thousand threatened and endangered species, and action is needed to prevent further extinctions. While climate change did contribute to the melomys' extinction, it is important to recognize the other environmental factors and the human choice to not save the species.

All 33 miners trapped in a gas explosion in a Chinese coal mine have been found dead. Two miners initially survived the explosion, but no others were found alive. Gas explosions in mines are often caused by sparks igniting leaked gas. The State Administration of Work Safety has ordered an investigation and vowed to punish those responsible. China's mining industry has a history of being dangerous, and the country plans to close over 1,000 outdated mines to reduce overproduction.

Seven leaders of an armed militia who led a 41-day stand-off at a US federal wildlife refuge in Oregon have been acquitted of conspiracy and firearms charges. The occupation of the refuge, which began in January, was a protest against federal control of land. The defendants argued that they did not intend to prevent federal officers from going to work, and the jury was unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that they had. The acquittal has been seen as a victory for states' rights and a blow to the federal government. The case against a second group of defendants is due to go to trial in February.

"The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has reported that levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have surpassed an important threshold and are unlikely to dip below it for ""many generations"". The 400 parts per million benchmark was broken globally for the first time in recorded history in 2015, and 2016 is expected to be the first full year to exceed this mark. The increase in CO2 levels can be attributed to a strong El Niño event, which caused drought conditions in tropical regions, reducing the ability of vegetation to absorb CO2. Additionally, there were extra emissions from fires sparked by the drier conditions. The WMO emphasizes the need to focus on cutting CO2 emissions in order to tackle climate change and keep temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius."

Since Donald Trump's election, there have been over 200 acts of election-related intimidation and harassment in the US, targeting marginalized groups such as black, Latino, Muslim, Jewish, Asian, queer people, and women. These acts include physical harm, hate speech, and racist graffiti. Trump supporters feel empowered to express their disdain for those they dislike or deem insignificant. It is crucial for America to stand united against these attacks and promote a message of intolerance towards hate.

The US military has admitted that civilians were likely killed in a joint Afghan-US operation in Kunduz, Afghanistan. The operation targeted Taliban leaders planning attacks in the city. Alongside the 30 civilians, two US service members were also killed. The US military expressed regret for the loss of innocent lives and promised to investigate the incident. Afghan forces, with US military advice, conducted the operation and encountered significant enemy fire. In addition to the civilian casualties, four members of Afghan special forces were killed, and 26 insurgents were killed. The Pentagon identified the dead US service members and expressed condolences. The incident occurred on the same day as a Taliban mortar attack that killed seven people attending a wedding party. In April, the Pentagon announced disciplinary action for a fatal US strike on a Kunduz hospital in 2015. The strike was deemed unintentional human error and equipment failure, rather than a war crime.

According to new government data, the rate of suicide deaths among children aged 10 to 14 has doubled since 2007. However, deaths from motor vehicle traffic and homicide have decreased over the same time period. Younger children may attempt suicide impulsively due to bad relationships with family and friends, while older children may do so because of relationship issues. Warning signs for suicide in children include increased sadness, irritability, anger, loss of interest in friends or activities, and saying mean or derogatory things. It is important for parents to talk to their children and listen to their feelings. There is limited research on suicide in children, and experts hope that the report will raise awareness and lead to more prevention efforts.

Trump also criticized the protests that have broken out since his election, calling them ""horrible"" and blaming the press for exaggerating the incidents. He discussed his plans for FBI Director James Comey, saying he hasn't made up his mind about whether to ask for his resignation. Trump also addressed his stance on same-sex marriage, abortion, and deporting undocumented immigrants. He pledged to focus on deporting criminals and building a border wall. Trump defended his transition team, which includes lobbyists, saying that they know the system but will be phased out.

Gay men are unable to donate blood to victims of the Orlando shooting due to a year-long celibacy requirement imposed by the FDA. These regulations were implemented in 2015, supposedly ending the ban on gay men's blood, but still prevent even monogamous gay men from donating. The ban originated in 1983 during the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but the American Medical Association has called for its end, stating it is discriminatory and lacks scientific basis. Misinformation spread on social media falsely claimed the ban had been lifted in Orlando. The ban is seen as unjustified, and other countries, like Argentina, have already abolished it. The Council on American-Islamic Relations is helping to maintain blood supplies. The article calls for the end of this oppressive policy and highlights the need for continued resistance in the face of tragedy.

The Supreme Court has halted the execution of an Alabama death row inmate, Thomas D. Arthur, for the seventh time. The execution was scheduled for Thursday evening but was stayed as officials waited for the Supreme Court to consider his appeals. Justice Clarence Thomas issued an order halting the execution until further notice. The court later granted Arthur's stay request, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voting in favor as a courtesy to his colleagues. The stay will remain in place until the justices decide whether to consider the case. Arthur was sentenced to death for the 1982 killing of Troy Wicker, the husband of a woman with whom Arthur had an affair. His attorneys argued against Alabama's lethal injection protocol and suggested execution by firing squad instead. The state's Department of Corrections is only allowed to carry out executions by injection and electrocution. Alabama's death penalty system has faced increased scrutiny following a Supreme Court ruling that struck down Florida's death penalty system.

Many families are leaving and there are some really heart-wrenching tales. SO SAD… Many are in fear.	Thousands of residents have fled the eastern neighborhoods of Mosul, the city held by the Islamic State, in the first significant wave of people escaping since the offensive to retake the city began two weeks ago. Over 1.2 million people are still believed to be trapped in Mosul, while newly constructed camps in the area can only accommodate 60,000 people. The fleeing residents, including shepherds with their herds of sheep, are heading towards a camp for displaced people on the banks of the Khazir River. Some of those who escaped were visibly relieved, removing their black veils and waving V for victory as Iraqi and Kurdish troops passed by. The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, released an audio recording calling on his followers to remain steadfast and fight. Iraqi commanders believe it is only a matter of time before the city is recaptured, but the fate of the civilians trapped inside remains uncertain. The number of civilians fleeing has significantly increased as fighting moves into more densely populated neighborhoods. Iraqi forces are trying to keep families in their homes as much as possible to avoid a humanitarian crisis, but many people are choosing to flee as conflict approaches. The Iraqi forces are also searching houses for Islamic State fighters trying to hide among civilians.

"A UK mom, Jodie Shaw, posted a photo of her C-section scar on Instagram to challenge the notion that C-sections are ""the easy way out."" Shaw explained that she had to have a C-section due to a fibroid and low-lying placenta. She wanted to show that sometimes women don't have a choice in their birth plans. The photo received positive responses and reached thousands of likes on social media. Shaw hopes her story educates people about different types of births and emphasizes that a C-section is still a valid method of giving birth."

Coconut trees are facing threats from lethal yellowing bacteria in the Caribbean, Cote d'Ivoire, and Papua New Guinea, which could lead to a shortage of coconuts. Unlike other crops, coconuts cannot be stored in seed vaults due to their high water content, so maintaining living gene banks is necessary. However, these gene banks require a lot of space and are vulnerable to land grabs. Additionally, growing and breeding coconuts is challenging due to their long maturation period and the need for hand pollination. Efforts to isolate and freeze coconut embryos for preservation are still unreliable. Funding for coconut gene banks is also limited, as most coconut growers are small farmers. The future of the Coconut Genetic Resources Network (COGENT) is uncertain due to funding issues.

With more people working isn’t there more tax revenue?  Confused but I feel for the poor...	"President Obama oversaw significant growth in federal spending to reduce inequality, but President-elect Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress are likely to undo these measures. Trump's proposed policies, such as building a border wall, deporting undocumented workers, and cutting taxes, could lead to financial panic and a possible recession. The repeal of Obamacare and the proposed tax cuts would disproportionately affect the poor, with millions potentially losing access to healthcare and the highest-income taxpayers benefiting the most. In order to balance the budget, the GOP would need to make significant spending cuts, which would likely impact assistance programs for the young and poor. Trump's vague plans make it unclear which specific policies would be eliminated, but House Speaker Paul Ryan's ""A Better Way"" plan provides some insight into potential cuts. Overall, Trump's presidency could make it much harder to be poor in America and represents a repudiation of Obama's economic policies."

Hello friend, have you read this article? I think you should, it's quite interesting if I do say so myself. It is about a Representative named Darrell Issa, he is a Republican and has a Southern California seat. How great would it be, to see this massively bad man lose? Hopefully, Issa may well quote Mercutio on November 8th: “...ask for me to-morrow and you shall find me a grave man.”	Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, is facing a tough re-election fight after years of comfortable victories. His decision to embrace Donald Trump has worsened his chances of winning. His opponent, Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel, has received significant financial support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Issa has tried to fight back by highlighting accusations made against Applegate by his former wife. In another California district, Representative Jeff Denham is also facing a tough re-election fight. Denham, like Issa, has expressed support for Trump. Both districts have a large and growing Latino population, which is expected to vote against Trump. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC have invested over $4 million to defeat Issa and Denham. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, has given over $1.6 million to Denham. Denham's refusal to disavow Trump has put him at odds with the editorial board of The Modesto Bee, the largest newspaper in his district, which has endorsed his opponent, Michael Eggman.

I can see why some might say that this is the last step before criminalization of the product and consumer.	"Environmental health officers are calling for a smoking ban in playgrounds, zoos, and other areas where children play. The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health wants local councils to designate these areas as smoking exclusion zones to reduce the chances of children thinking that smoking is normal. The ban would also protect children from secondhand smoke. A recent poll showed that 89% of adults surveyed support a ban on smoking in children's play areas. Some councils have already implemented voluntary bans in certain outdoor places. Forest, a smokers' rights group, criticized the proposal, calling it ""Orwellian."" The smoking ban in enclosed public places has been in effect in the UK since 2007."

The Kenyan government has deported a senior South Sudan opposition member, James Gatdet Dak, despite threats against him. This comes after the UN dismissed the Kenyan general in charge of the peacekeeping force in South Sudan for failing to protect civilians during recent violence. Dak, a spokesman for the main South Sudanese rebel group, expressed support for the removal of the Kenyan top officer in the UN mission in South Sudan in a Facebook post. The conflict in South Sudan has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and displacement of hundreds of thousands. Human rights experts warn that Dak is at risk in South Sudan. Kenya has threatened to withdraw its peacekeeping troops from South Sudan following the dismissal of their general. The row between the UN and the Kenyan government highlights the tense relations between the two.

I think with President Trump backing out of the Paris Agreement and not really focusing a little bit of more efforts on global warming, there can be a big problem in the future.	Donald Trump's proposed environmental policies include eliminating the EPA, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, and cutting federal spending on clean energy. Environmental groups are preparing for a fight, as these actions could have significant negative impacts on the planet. The biggest threats posed by the Trump administration include backing out of the Paris Agreement, killing the Clean Power Plan, eliminating the EPA, appointing climate change deniers to lead the EPA and Department of Energy, cutting federal spending on clean energy, avoiding regulations on methane, and opening federal lands to oil and gas drilling. However, it may be difficult for Trump to repeal and revise these regulations, and there is still hope for the planet as clean energy initiatives and pollution regulations have widespread support among the American people. Environmental organizations are prepared to fight against these policies.

Former Wells Fargo employees have described the mental health nightmares they experienced while working at the bank. Many employees suffered from stress-induced migraines, severe anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems due to the high-pressure work environment and unethical practices. Some employees were rewarded for using unethical practices to meet unrealistic sales goals, while others were constantly observed and critiqued by managers. The experiences of these employees highlight the toll that a toxic work culture can have on mental health. Wells Fargo has acknowledged its failures and is making changes to support its employees and uphold a customer-focused culture. The extreme stress and involvement in illegal activity can worsen mental health problems. Even managers at the bank experienced severe depression and anxiety. The mental health nightmares extended to employees in the mortgage division as well, with bullying, punishment, and intimidation being common. Employees were constantly measured against each other and bonuses were sometimes blocked. The lack of compassion from supervisors during personal crises led some employees to quit. The experiences of these employees have left a lasting impact on their mental health and perception of Wells Fargo.

Consumer Reports has released a report identifying fifteen supplement ingredients that can cause illness or even death. The risks associated with these ingredients include cancer, organ damage, and cardiac arrest. The severity of the threats depends on factors such as pre-existing conditions, the quantity of ingredients taken, and the length of exposure. The report lists the dangerous ingredients, including aconite, caffeine powder, chaparral, coltsfoot, comfrey, germander, greater celandine, green tea extract powder, Kava, lobelia, methylsynephrine, pennyroyal oil, red yeast rice, usnic acid, and Yohimbe. The report warns against the use of these ingredients due to their potential health risks. The CDC has reported that the use of dietary supplements in the United States is common, with over forty percent of the population using them from 1998 to 2004. Multivitamins and multiminerals are the most commonly used products.

A recent study has found that rates of toddlers and preschoolers being hospitalized for opioid overdoses have more than doubled in recent years. The study analyzed data from over 13,000 records of children admitted to U.S. hospitals between 1997 and 2012. The increase in overdoses is possibly due to the rise in prescribed painkillers, such as OxyContin and Vicodin. Young children are often exposed to these drugs by finding pills on the floor, getting into their parents' purses, or opening bottles. The study emphasizes the need for parents to limit children's exposure to these medications and for companies to improve packaging. The study also highlights the underreported issue of young overdoses in the pediatrics community. Additionally, the study found that heroin poisonings among children increased by 161%.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man responsible for the bombings in Manhattan and on the Jersey Shore, had been planning the attacks for months and was inspired by international terrorists, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The complaint details the extent of the damage caused by the bombs, including shattered windows and victims with ball bearings and metal fragments in their bodies. It was also revealed that Rahami's father had previously expressed concerns to the authorities about his son's potential involvement in terrorism, but no further action was taken. Rahami's notebook, recovered after he was shot and wounded by the police, contained writings expressing his extremist Islamic ideology and admiration for terrorist figures. The complaint also mentions that Rahami had been acquiring materials for his weapons through eBay. The investigation is ongoing to determine if Rahami had any assistance in building the bombs.

One year after a dam ruptured in Brazil, causing a massive mudslide and environmental disaster, the people living along the affected river are still afraid to drink the water and eat the fish. The mudslide buried towns, killed 19 people, and caused extensive damage to the environment. The cleanup efforts by the mining company responsible have been slow and ineffective, and doubts remain about the safety of the river water. The government's priority now is to reforest the river banks to prevent further contamination. Many businesses, including fishing and steelmaking, rely on the river, and fishermen who lost their livelihoods receive compensation. However, many fishermen have lost hope of ever fishing in the river again.

A new study reveals that U.S. veterans have a high prevalence of sleep disorders, with sixteen percent of veterans with PTSD experiencing sleep disorders. The prevalence of sleep disorders among veterans has increased from less than one percent in 2000 to about six percent in 2010. Sleep apnea is the most common sleep disorder among veterans, followed by insomnia. Veterans with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic diseases also have higher rates of sleep disorders. The study did not establish a direct link between PTSD and sleep disorders, but a follow-up study will examine this connection.

The text describes an undercover investigation into the exploitation of Syrian refugees and children in the garment industry in Turkey. The investigation reveals that many Syrian refugees, who lack work permits, are forced to work illegally in factories for low wages. The factories often hide workers during audits and continue exploiting them once the auditors leave. Some brands are aware of the abuses and are trying to address them, but others are unaware of the conditions in their supply chain. The investigation concludes that until brands have full visibility into their supply chain, the exploitation of refugees and children is likely to persist.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred during a religious ceremony in the remote mountains of Balochistan. The region's remoteness made it challenging to provide emergency services, but rescue operations are underway. Pakistan's Prime Minister has condemned the blast and ordered authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice. This is not the first time ISIS has targeted Pakistan, as they previously attacked a police academy in Quetta, resulting in numerous casualties.

Insha Mushtaq, a 14-year-old girl from Indian-administered Kashmir, lost her vision in both eyes after being hit by pellets. She has been in and out of hospitals for the past three months in an attempt to regain her vision, but nothing has worked so far. Insha remains hopeful and still dreams of becoming a doctor. The ongoing unrest in Kashmir has resulted in the deaths of 89 civilians and thousands of injuries. Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir, and the region has been a source of conflict for over 60 years. Pellet guns, originally used as a non-lethal weapon in 2010, have caused over a thousand eye injuries in recent months. Insha's family is struggling to cope with her injuries, and she tries to stay positive despite the challenges ahead.

Islamic State fighters launched a series of car bomb attacks in northern Syria as U.S.-backed forces began their push to retake Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State. The operation aims to isolate Raqqa and cut off supply routes for the militants. The car bomb attacks were a preview of the fierce battle that lies ahead. The U.S.-led coalition conducted airstrikes in support of the offensive. However, the U.S. also sought to calm Turkey, which is concerned about the increased influence of Kurdish groups in the region. The Obama administration faces the challenge of balancing its relationship with Turkey and the Syrian Kurdish forces it supports. Talks were held to secure Turkish support for the operation and to reassure Ankara that the offensive would not benefit Syrian Kurds.

While the virus has infected over 650,000 people in the region, the majority of babies born with congenital neurological damage linked to Zika have been clustered in northeastern Brazil. Health officials and scientists are investigating other factors that may be contributing to the higher toll in this region, such as the presence of other mosquito-borne viruses or environmental and genetic factors. The number of cases of birth defects linked to Zika outside of Brazil has been relatively low, leading researchers to caution that it will take years to fully understand the dangers the virus poses to babies' brains. The outbreak in Puerto Rico is being closely monitored, but the mainland United States has so far averted a major outbreak. The lack of funding for Zika research and prevention has hindered efforts to accurately count the number of people infected and assess the true impact of the virus.

Airstrikes by a U.S.-backed Saudi-led coalition in the Yemeni city of Hodeidah killed at least 43 people and injured many more, according to Yemeni officials and local news reports. The strikes targeted a security complex where prisoners were being held. The city is controlled by Houthi rebels, who also control the capital and much of northern Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition claimed that the complex was being used as a command center by the rebels. The airstrikes occurred on the same day that Yemen's internationally recognized president rejected a new U.N. peace proposal. The conflict in Yemen has resulted in the deaths of over 10,000 people and has caused a humanitarian crisis in the country.

A tugboat crash in British Columbia's coastal waters caused a diesel fuel leak, endangering wildlife and prompting efforts to recover the affected species. Divers found endangered abalone and juvenile herring in the fuel spill area. The outer boom meant to contain the oil broke free, spreading the oil further. Salvage crews have recovered 40% of the estimated 200,000 liters of fuel. The marine life in the Gale Passage, including a crucial herring spawning area, is at risk. The local clam fishery has been shut down, and the spill response has been criticized. Diesel is highly toxic to marine creatures. Additional protection measures are being considered.

Well hopefully not your family gone cause then you'd really be in trouble but your hosue at least and sentimental things. I hope that never happens to you.	Wildfires near the Georgia-North Carolina line have led to evacuations and the need for residents to wear masks outdoors. The largest wildfire has burned over 13,000 acres and is only 20% contained. Special health masks are being distributed in North Carolina as regular surgical masks do not provide enough protection from smoke particles. Despite the smoke, the Charlotte Marathon was able to proceed as planned. Many of the wildfires are suspected arsons, with a dark blue SUV being sought in one case. In Tennessee, 72% of active wildfires are suspected arsons. In North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, over 20 wildfires are being investigated for suspected arson. The federal government has approved funding to fight the fires in western North Carolina. In South Carolina, residents are being asked to donate drinks to help firefighters battling a wildfire.

Violence has escalated between Myanmar's security forces and the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim population. Two soldiers were killed by attackers armed with guns, knives, and spears. In retaliation, the government used helicopters to fire at the attackers. The area is closed to Western journalists, making it difficult to verify the scale of the fighting. The Rohingya have been under siege since the government sent security forces to hunt for armed Rohingya assailants who had killed nine police officers. Human rights groups have received reports of killings, rapes, and beatings of Rohingya civilians. Western diplomats have called for an independent investigation into the violence, but Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has declined. The Rohingya population has been subjected to decades of repression, making them susceptible to radicalization. The government's harsh proposals may have been the catalyst for the recent attacks. The Rohingya villages have become armed camps, with reports of food scarcity, curfews, and rape by soldiers. Myanmar officials deny the occurrence of rapes.

A study published in Plos One reveals that Americans waste a significant amount of food, with about 133 billion pounds of edible food going uneaten in 2010. Two-thirds of this waste is attributed to consumers. The paper highlights the negative environmental impact of food waste, as 95% of it ends up in landfills. Ohio State University professor Brian Roe suggests that increasing awareness of the issue can lead to purposeful action to reduce food waste. A national survey conducted last year found that 53% of Americans are aware of the problem, a 10% increase from a previous study. The survey also revealed that many people believe throwing away food after the package date reduces the risk of food-related illnesses and that some food waste is necessary for freshness. Additionally, 77% of respondents feel guilty about wasting food, while 58% understand the environmental consequences. However, 51% believe it is difficult to reduce home food waste, and 42% claim to lack the time to address the issue.

Two men have been arrested in connection with the stabbing death of a partygoer in Manhattan. James Rackover, a surrogate son to celebrity jeweler Jeffrey Rackover, and Lawrence Dilione have been charged with hindering prosecution, tampering with evidence, and concealing a corpse. The victim, Joseph Comunale, was stabbed 15 times and his partially burned body was found buried under a foot of earth. The motive for the attack is still under investigation, but sources suggest it may have been triggered by Comunale rejecting sexual advances. The suspects attempted to bleach the victim's blood from his clothes and used gasoline to try to burn his body. The case has shocked friends of Jeffrey Rackover, who described James as the son he never had.

A new review suggests that sleep disorders increase the risk of stroke and affect recovery. The study found a link between sleep breathing problems and stroke risk and recovery, but less evidence for the link between sleep-wake disorders and stroke. People with sleep disorders may be more likely to have another stroke or other health problems. For those with sleep apnea, treatment with a continuous positive airway pressure machine (CPAP) is recommended. A CDC report shows that a significant number of Americans have sleep disorders, indicating a need for public awareness and education about the importance of sleep.

A study from the University of Copenhagen has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study, which tracked one million Danish women for 13 years, found that women taking the combined oral contraceptive were 23% more likely to be diagnosed with depression, while those using progestin-only pills were 34% more likely. Teens were at the greatest risk, with an 80% increase in depression when taking the combined pill. Other hormone-based methods, such as the hormonal IUS/coil, the patch, and the ring, were shown to increase depression at a higher rate than oral contraceptives. The study suggests that the practice of encouraging teens to use these alternatives to the pill is misguided. The medical community's response to the study has been dismissive, with experts downplaying the link and offering paternalistic advice. The burden of avoiding unwanted pregnancy falls on women, despite the potential negative effects on their health and wellbeing. Effective alternatives to hormonal contraceptives exist, but they are often overlooked. It is important to remember that women are twice as likely to experience depression as men, and blaming women's depression on their biological femaleness is acceptable, but blaming medication formulated from synthetic hormones is not. The study's authors plan to research the possible association between hormonal birth control and suicide attempts or completions. While not every woman experiences depression and anxiety from hormonal contraceptives, it is important to acknowledge that many do, and their lives could be improved by recognizing and addressing this issue.

The Zika virus has been known to scientists for decades, but it has only recently become a serious public health concern. The majority of infected individuals do not experience symptoms, making it difficult to test for. Pregnant women are particularly at risk, as the virus can cause birth defects. Zika primarily spreads through infected mosquitoes, but it can also be transmitted through sexual contact. There is currently no vaccine or treatment for Zika, but scientists are making progress in developing them. The virus is prevalent in many countries, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Zika was first discovered in monkeys in Uganda in 1947 and has since spread to various parts of the world. In the United States, there have been thousands of cases, with Puerto Rico being heavily affected. The CDC has issued travel warnings for Zika in many countries.

"The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, was known to the FBI for years but was not considered a security threat. This highlights the challenge of identifying ""lone wolf"" terrorists who are not connected to established extremist groups. The FBI retains data on individuals even after determining they are not a threat, raising concerns about privacy rights. The shooting has sparked debate about whether individuals interviewed by the FBI should be able to purchase guns or be under continued surveillance. The FBI interviewed Mateen multiple times but was unable to find any suspicious ties. The bureau is allowed to keep data on individuals even after closing investigations, which has raised concerns about privacy. Trust between local communities and the government is crucial in identifying domestic lone-wolf extremists before they commit acts of terrorism. The difficulty in identifying individuals like Mateen highlights the lack of a profile for potential terrorists."

In Australia's Vasse River, goldfish have thrived and grown to large sizes, with some reaching 16 inches and four pounds. Goldfish invasions have also been reported in other places like Nevada, Colorado, and Alberta. The growth rate of goldfish in the Vasse River is the fastest known in the world. The problem with goldfish invasions stems from a disconnect between how people view goldfish as cute pets and their behavior in the wild. Goldfish are capable of rapid reproduction, uprooting vegetation, disturbing sediment, and transmitting diseases and parasites. Eradicating goldfish is difficult once they are established. Recent research has shown that goldfish are long-distance swimmers and migrate to spawn. Understanding goldfish behavior can help inform management strategies. It is crucial for pet owners to responsibly dispose of unwanted fish to prevent further invasions. Flushing fish down the toilet is not recommended.

Senator Mark Kirk apologized to his opponent, Representative Tammy Duckworth, after using her Thai heritage to criticize her family's military history during a debate. Duckworth accepted the apology and urged Kirk to focus on the issues. Kirk had questioned Duckworth's ties to the American Revolution, to which she responded by highlighting her family's long history of military service. Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's campaign manager, mocked Kirk over the incident. Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who lost her legs and partial use of her right arm during a mission, was born in Thailand but has deep American roots.

A 5.7 magnitude earthquake in Tanzania has resulted in 13 deaths and over 200 injuries. The quake struck near the town of Bukoba and was felt as far away as Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya. Rescue operations are ongoing, and some houses have collapsed. The situation is currently calm and under control, with no expectation of many more injuries. The earthquake was felt in the Great Lakes region, but earthquakes of this intensity are uncommon. The regional hospital is overwhelmed, and emergency operations are poor. The earthquake did not cause any damage in Dar es Salaam, but concerns remain for the safety of families in the affected area.

A study published in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery reveals that one in ten Americans suffer from tinnitus, a persistent buzzing or ringing in the ears. The study found that tinnitus is connected to hearing loss and is often not discussed with doctors. The research also shows that higher rates of tinnitus are reported in individuals with consistent exposure to loud noises, either at work or during recreational activities. Treatment options include hearing aids and psychotherapy to change the way affected individuals think about tinnitus.

Trump and Pence have expressed intentions to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which covers birth control. In response, some women are considering getting an intrauterine device (IUD) as a long-lasting form of birth control that could outlast any changes made by the administration. IUDs are highly effective and safe, with some versions lasting up to 12 years. Women are advised to take action soon, as an IUD can cost up to $1,000 without insurance coverage. Planned Parenthood offers a guide for those interested in learning more about IUDs. The fate of the Affordable Care Act and its birth control provisions is uncertain after President Obama leaves office on January 20, 2017.

Conversion therapy is a set of practices aimed at changing a person's sexuality or gender identity to fit heterosexual or cisgender norms. It is often religiously motivated and can include methods such as talk therapy, electroshock therapy, and aversion therapy. A survivor of conversion therapy, TC, shared his experience of being subjected to these practices, including harassment and physical abuse. Conversion therapy has been linked to serious harm, including increased rates of suicide and mental health issues among LGBTQ individuals. While mainstream psychiatric organizations do not support conversion therapy, it is still promoted in some circles. Only five states and the District of Columbia have laws protecting LGBTQ youth from being forced into conversion therapy. TC, who escaped conversion therapy, emphasizes the need to recognize the harm caused by these practices and to treat LGBTQ individuals with dignity and respect.

The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline received a significant increase in calls, with the volume being two to three times higher than usual. The Crisis Text Line also experienced a surge in texts, with eight times the normal volume. The Trevor Project, which provides support to LGBTQ youth, saw a doubling of call volume, with more than 95% of callers discussing the election. The Trans Lifeline, which supports the transgender community, has been flooded with calls since the election, receiving more than 500 calls a day. The election results have caused panic and fear among callers, particularly regarding the potential loss of insurance and trans-affirming healthcare. These crisis hotlines are urging people to support each other, get back to routines, and limit exposure to media that exacerbates feelings of hopelessness. Acts of kindness and compassion are also encouraged to help alleviate anxiety.

"An animal-welfare organization called Four Paws recently rescued the remaining animals from a zoo near the Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis. The zoo, known as the ""world's worst zoo,"" had a history of neglect and animal deaths, including taxidermy of dead animals. The rescue mission was complicated due to the ongoing conflict in the region, but the team successfully evacuated the animals and transferred them to sanctuaries. The rescue has been hailed as a milestone in animal rights, but concerns remain about the wider issues of wildlife trafficking and the commercialization of wild animals in Gaza. The rescued animals will now receive care and rehabilitation in their new homes. There are hopes to create new legislation in Gaza to address these issues and prevent animal smuggling. The organization is also concerned about other zoos in conflict zones that require immediate attention."

Record-breaking temperatures this summer have raised concerns about the impact of climate change on the region. Even if warming is limited to 2°C, the Mediterranean region would still experience unprecedented changes. Morocco could face increased temperatures and drought, leading to the displacement of forests and expansion of deserts. The fossil fuel industry's recklessness is pushing the planet towards catastrophe, and urgent action is needed to address this. Governments must divest from climate destruction and invest in renewable energy. Ending fossil fuel subsidies and removing the industry's influence from climate talks are crucial steps. Legal action is also being taken against major carbon emitters. The demand to world leaders is to stop new fossil fuel projects and transition to 100% renewable energy.

Modi argued that the ban was necessary to fight corruption and reduce the use of unaccounted-for cash in the country. However, opposition leaders and many citizens have criticized the move, as people have faced long lines at banks and ATMs, and many machines have run out of cash. Despite the hardships, some individuals expressed support for the ban, believing that it will ultimately benefit the nation. The transition to new currency notes has been complicated by the fact that many ATMs are not working and cannot dispense the new notes. The Finance Ministry reported that Indians have deposited about $45 billion in banned currency notes since the policy began, while banks and ATMs have given out $7.5 billion in new currency notes. The ban has had a significant impact on businesses, with sales falling and customers unable to pay with cash. While some individuals believe the ban is necessary, others argue that it is causing unnecessary suffering for the poor and that the real black money is hidden in Swiss bank accounts.

"At least 26 Afghan civilians were killed and many others injured in airstrikes in Kunduz province, Afghanistan, while NATO and Afghan forces were fighting Taliban fighters. Two American service members also died in ground clashes. Conflicting reports on the number of casualties and no official account of the airstrikes have been provided. Some local officials claim that up to 100 civilians were killed or wounded. The incident is reminiscent of the tragic events in Kunduz last year when a U.S. airstrike mistakenly targeted a hospital, killing 42 patients and staff members. NATO officials have not confirmed the reported deaths of the civilians. Angry relatives of the victims attempted to protest, but were stopped by security forces. U.S. military officials confirmed the deaths of the two American service members and stated their commitment to helping Afghan partners defend their nation. The NATO mission in Afghanistan issued a statement referring to airstrikes by ""friendly forces"" but did not confirm any civilian casualties. The Taliban claimed that three of their fighters were targeted and killed, along with a large number of civilians."

A recent study suggests that men conceived through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a type of in vitro fertilization, may have lower sperm concentration and more fertility struggles compared to men conceived naturally. The study focused on 54 men conceived through ICSI and found that they had lower average sperm concentration, total sperm count, and total motile sperm count. The researchers suggest that couples should be informed about this potential outcome before undergoing ICSI. However, the study also found that a low sperm concentration in fathers did not necessarily match the values found in their sons. Therefore, some men conceived through ICSI may still be able to father children naturally. It is recommended for them to start trying to conceive at a younger age, as fertility declines with age.

"A new report by environmental group Amazon Watch reveals that the United States is driving the destruction of the Amazon rainforest by importing crude oil from the region. American refineries processed over 230,000 barrels of Amazon crude oil per day last year, with California alone refining an average of 170,978 barrels per day. The expansion of oil drilling in the Amazon poses a serious threat to the region, with proposed oil and gas fields covering an area larger than Texas. The destruction of the Amazon rainforest releases greenhouse gases and puts indigenous communities and biodiversity at risk. Ecuador's state oil company recently started drilling near the biologically rich Yasuni national park. Indigenous communities are at risk of pollution, displacement, and deadly illnesses. Amazon Watch is calling for a reduction in Amazon crude imports and the establishment of ""no go zones"" in decision making."

A new study from Harvard and Columbia universities estimates that the haze from Indonesian fires last year may have caused over 100,000 premature deaths in Southeast Asia. The previous official death toll was only 19 deaths in Indonesia. The fires, set to clear land for palm oil and pulpwood plantations, occur mainly on Sumatra and Borneo, with the haze blowing over Singapore and Malaysia. The study combined satellite data with health impact models and pollution readings to estimate that 91,600 deaths occurred in Indonesia, 6,500 in Malaysia, and 2,200 in Singapore. The study only looked at health impacts on adults and the effect of fine-particulate matter, not the impact on children or other toxins produced by the fires. Last year's fires were among the worst in memory, causing widespread illness and diplomatic tensions.

I don't understand why they don't cage in the turbine blades like they do with house fans. I mean it sucks bird kind everywhere, but it's either the turbine or toxic smog.	Wind turbines are not only killing local birds, but also birds from hundreds of miles away, according to researchers from Purdue University and the U.S. Geological Survey. Using DNA and stable isotopes, the researchers found that golden eagles killed at a wind farm in California can come from far distances. This raises concerns about the impact of wind farms on bird populations. The Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) in California, one of the oldest and largest wind farms in the world, has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of birds. The researchers found that eagles are attracted to the area due to the abundance of prey and the windy conditions, but fail to see the turbine blades and get hit. The study also revealed that a large percentage of the birds killed are from neighboring states, highlighting the need for environmental assessments to consider the impact on the entire population. The findings have implications for the management of wind energy facilities and the conservation of bird species.

The attack also wounded 16 US service members and one Polish soldier. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it had been planned for four months. The US Embassy in Kabul will be closed as a precautionary measure. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg expressed support for those affected by the attack and reiterated NATO's commitment to fighting terrorism. Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice.

Despite significant progress in global vaccination efforts, measles still claims the lives of more than 350 children daily, according to a report by UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and other health agencies. The report emphasizes that the fight against measles is hindered not by a lack of tools or knowledge, but by a lack of political will to ensure every child is immunized. While vaccination campaigns and increased routine vaccine coverage have saved millions of lives, there are still countries where a majority of children are not vaccinated. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan account for half of all unvaccinated babies and 75% of measles-related deaths. Outbreaks of measles in various countries, caused by gaps in immunization, remain a significant problem. The report highlights the need to immunize young people who have missed out on vaccinations and notes that measles tends to resurge during conflicts or humanitarian crises.

I feel that if you were to come down to visit the area, then there would be something similar happening to other people. Ambushes, riots, and shootings are all problems occurring in the area. I feel bad for this city as it has a chance to redeem itself as a great city; however, with all the criminal activities happening, it makes it difficult to do that.	One police officer was killed and another was wounded in a shooting in western Pennsylvania. The officers were responding to a domestic dispute when they were ambushed. A man and a woman were later found dead in a nearby home. The officer who was killed was identified as Scott Leslie Bashioum. The other officer was flown to a nearby trauma center, but there is no update on their condition. Local schools were canceled while SWAT officers searched for the suspect. The governor of Pennsylvania expressed his condolences. This incident adds to the increasing number of police officers killed by firearms in 2016.

The families of 43 missing Mexican college students are leading a march in Mexico City to demand their return on the second anniversary of their disappearance. The students were intercepted by local police and handed over to a drug cartel while hijacking buses in 2014.

One father believes his son and the others are still alive and that the families will never trust the government.

"PTSD is a misunderstood and stigmatized disorder that affects many veterans. It is estimated that 8 million Americans suffer from PTSD, with rates among Vietnam War and Iraq War veterans being particularly high. The negative connotations surrounding PTSD prevent many veterans from seeking help. Veterans want others to know that referring to them as ""weak"" is ignorant, as war experiences are incomprehensible to those who haven't lived through them. PTSD symptoms can be masked and go unnoticed, making it difficult to recognize. Many PTSD sufferers suffer in silence, fearing judgment and trying to appear strong. Contrary to popular belief, PTSD does not make individuals violent. Recovery from PTSD is possible, and veterans encourage others to seek help and know that they are not alone."

This year, a record number of people have drowned in the Mediterranean while attempting to escape war and seek a better life. Over 3,800 people have died, averaging about 90 deaths per week. The largest migration of refugees since World War II is currently taking place, with over 65 million people displaced from their homes. Despite fewer people crossing this year compared to 2015, the death toll has increased. The main routes across the Mediterranean are from Turkey to Greece, Libya to Italy, and West Africa to Spain. Syria produces the most refugees, with nearly five million fleeing the country due to civil war. The war in Syria has also resulted in an estimated 430,000 deaths. While some refugees are resettled in countries like the United States and Canada, the majority seek asylum in Europe or remain in the Middle East. With no end to the war in sight, the refugee crisis and the loss of lives will continue.

The frog, featured in the Photo Ark project, served as a symbol of the extinction crisis. Toughie's species was only described in 2008, three years after he was found during a frog rescue mission. The deadly chytrid fungus wiped out up to 85% of amphibians in Toughie's habitat. Photographer Joel Sartore, who photographed Toughie for the Photo Ark project, emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about extinction. He believes that people need to meet and fall in love with these animals to care about their preservation. The loss of species threatens healthy ecosystems and ultimately our own survival. Sartore warns that if we continue on this path, we could lose half of all species by the end of the century.

A year ago their mother left for another town to get treatment for high blood pressure from a traditional healer, leaving Zulyatu alone to care for her siblings, 12-year-old Abubakar and 8-year-old Amira.	Millions of Nigerians are facing a severe hunger crisis, exacerbated by the ongoing conflict with Boko Haram. The situation is particularly dire in Borno state, where nearly a quarter of a million children are severely malnourished. Aid organizations like Mercy Corps are working to provide assistance, but many areas remain unreachable due to insecurity. The Nigerian military must secure these areas to allow aid workers safe passage. However, funding for the crisis is lacking, with less than one-third of the United Nations appeals being funded. Mercy Corps is providing financial assistance, repairing water points, and offering protection to vulnerable civilians. Despite the challenges, organizations are determined to scale up their operations and make a difference.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man responsible for the bombings in Manhattan and on the Jersey Shore, had been planning the attacks for months and was inspired by international terrorists, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The complaint details the extent of the damage caused by the bombs, including shattered windows and victims with ball bearings and metal fragments in their bodies. It was also revealed that Rahami's father had previously expressed concerns to the authorities about his son's potential involvement in terrorism, but no further action was taken. Rahami's notebook, recovered after he was shot and wounded by the police, contained writings expressing his extremist Islamic ideology and admiration for terrorist figures. The complaint also mentions that Rahami had been acquiring materials for his weapons through eBay. The investigation is ongoing to determine if Rahami had any assistance in building the bombs.

Pakistan is expelling over 100 Turkish schoolteachers at the request of Turkey's President Erdogan. The expulsion is seen as an appeasement to Erdogan's demand to close schools linked to exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan accuses of orchestrating a coup attempt. Turkey has arrested tens of thousands of people suspected of ties to Gulen since the coup, and Erdogan has pressured other countries to aid in the crackdown. Pakistan is one of the few countries to comply. The affected schools deny any affiliation with political organizations and are petitioning against the expulsions. Over 400 Turkish citizens will have to leave Pakistan, but Erdogan reassured the students that they would not suffer.

This incident brings attention to the attacks on priests in Mexico, with two others being found shot to death after being kidnapped.

However, the IRC warns that deferring the closure will not address the refugees' concerns about violence, displacement, and gender-based violence in Somalia. The IRC emphasizes the need for support and integration programs for refugees, as well as investment in Somalia to provide earning opportunities.

"Azealia Banks tearfully shared her side of the Russell Crowe incident in a new interview. She described the argument that led to her being kicked out of Crowe's hotel room as ""humiliating."" Banks claimed that Crowe made disparaging comments about her career, and when she responded, the whole table turned against her. She alleged that Crowe called her the N-word, choked her, and physically removed her from the suite. However, a source close to Crowe denied these claims and stated that he acted in defense of his guests. Banks also expressed disappointment that RZA, who invited her to the party, did not stand up for her. RZA later contradicted Banks' narrative and accused her of threatening someone with a glass. Despite the backlash, Banks remains resilient and confident in her youth and music career."

Protesters in Charlotte, North Carolina are demanding an end to racism and systemic oppression. They believe that true change can only happen by completely abolishing incarceration and the police department. They emphasize the importance of education and awareness about racism and injustice. The protesters argue that black lives need to matter for all lives to matter. They also call for more understanding of the justice system and individual rights. Some protesters highlight the historical context of racism in America and stress the need for new tactics to achieve liberation. They criticize the hypocrisy of the nation and compare the struggle for racial equality to the American Revolution.

The occupation of the refuge, which began in January, was a protest against federal control of land. The defendants argued that they did not intend to prevent federal officers from going to work, and the jury was unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that they had. The acquittal has been seen as a victory for states' rights and a blow to the federal government. The case against a second group of defendants is due to go to trial in February.

A deadly shooting occurred at a Starbucks in Las Vegas after a customer's card was declined. The suspect fired shots in the air and then at a customer, who later died. The incident was initially treated as a hostage situation, causing a delay in medical treatment. The suspect called the police and falsely described a different shooter. The suspect, a Hispanic man with a criminal history, was later detained and found to be in possession of a gun.

It spouts some numbers and facts but I can see straight away this is a fabricated article that is completely biased. This is the crap we need to take out of our news.	Cows release methane gas, a greenhouse gas, which has a much higher negative effect on the climate compared to carbon dioxide. The livestock industry, including cattle breeding and farming, is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector. Livestock pastures and feed production use a significant portion of the Earth's land surface, leading to deforestation and habitat loss. The increasing demand for meat and dairy products contributes to the overgrowth of the farming industry and its impact on global warming. Producing one kilogram of beef emits an equivalent amount of CO2 as an average European car every 250 kilometers and consumes a significant amount of energy. Consuming less meat and dairy products is an effective way to reduce one's carbon footprint and protect the environment.

An investigation by Human Rights Watch has concluded that the deadly attack on a school in Syria was carried out by Syrian regime and Russian warplanes. Russia initially denied that any airstrikes had taken place, but satellite imagery and drone footage released by the Russian Ministry of Defence showed damage consistent with HRW's evidence. HRW has compiled video evidence and witness testimonies, and called on Russia to conduct a thorough investigation. This attack is one of many targeting civilian infrastructure in Syria, with over 4,200 schools damaged or destroyed during the six-year war. Efforts are being made to establish culpability for war crimes committed in Syria through the UN General Assembly and national courts in Europe and the United States.

"Filmmaker and activist Michael Moore wrote a ""Morning After To-Do List"" for Democrats, urging them to fire pundits, pollsters, and media members who clung to an incorrect election narrative. He also called for Democrats to remove any members of Congress who aren't ready to fight and to remind people that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. Moore argued that Trump's victory was not a surprise, as he had predicted it in his film ""Michael Moore in TrumpLand."" He attributed Trump's success to the anger and despair of working-class Americans who have been neglected by both parties.

Armed police in North Dakota have arrested 141 Native American protesters and environmental activists who were occupying private land in the path of a controversial new oil pipeline. The police used non-lethal rounds, pepper spray, and sound cannons to push the protesters back to their main encampment on public land. Skirmishes lasted overnight and continued until early Friday morning. The protesters were demonstrating against the pipeline, which they believe threatens the region's water supply and crosses land never ceded by the tribe. The police claimed they used non-lethal bean bag rounds in response to stone throwing and a woman firing a pistol at officers. The protest has been ongoing for months and has drawn the attention of activists and celebrities.

No one can be expected to learn or do anything productive  if they can't even get the basic necessities	Venezuelan children are fainting and falling asleep in school due to hunger. Many students are absent because their families cannot afford to buy food. One teacher reported that a student skipped class every Thursday because it was their family's designated day to buy food at government-regulated prices. Another teacher witnessed a child faint during a cultural event because they had only eaten an arepa at 10 a.m. and it was already 3 p.m. The government spends very little on meals in public schools, and a lawmaker criticized the government for prioritizing weapons over food. A recent poll revealed that 48% of the time children do not attend school, it is due to food-related issues. Many children eat only twice a day or even just once, and for some, the school lunch is their only meal of the day. Some parents are considering changing their children from private to public schools, while others are contemplating taking their children out of school altogether. In addition to the food crisis, public schools are also facing infrastructure problems, with stolen computers and desks and a lack of funds for school supplies.

Canadian clothing manufacturer Gildan Activewear has agreed to acquire intellectual property assets and inventory from American Apparel for $66 million. The company's stores will remain open while it pursues a sale of its operations, but liquidation is a serious risk. American Apparel's chief restructuring officer stated that the company's turnaround strategy completely failed, with a 33% decline in year-over-year sales. The company has faced financial troubles for years, including the firing of its CEO in 2014 and strategic missteps. American Apparel currently has 110 stores and listed about $215 million in debts.

The mother attempted to push the stroller into the out-of-service elevator on the 23rd floor, but it wasn't there. Both the mother and the baby fell onto the roof of the elevator and then dropped further to the 17th floor. The baby was found unconscious and unresponsive and was pronounced dead at the hospital. The cause of death is still unknown, and an investigation is ongoing. The apartment complex has a history of elevator violations, with over 120 violations since 2005. The elevator involved in the incident had been inspected recently, and one non-hazardous violation was issued. The building's elevator service company declined to comment, and the Elevator Industries Association did not respond to inquiries. The incident is now under investigation, and all elevators in the complex will be tested for safety.

Lead contamination in a housing project in South Los Angeles is putting 300 children at risk of lead poisoning. Elevated blood lead levels have been recorded in the children, with some levels well above the CDC threshold. The former industrial site near the housing project has been found to have elevated lead and arsenic levels. The proposed lowering of the lead detection level for federal cleanup action could affect millions of subsidized and public housing units. The site has been cleaned up, but residents are concerned about the impact of planned demolition. Lead levels have also been found in nearby schools, but authorities claim they are not a risk to human health. The housing project also faces other pollution issues, including a trichloroethylene plume in the groundwater and a breach in an underground oil pipeline. Soil tests conducted by a nonprofit organization found that over 50% of the samples taken exceeded the cleanup threshold. The situation has been described as a case of environmental racism.

"The eldest generation in Russia, known as the ""children of the war,"" are living in poverty. Despite surviving World War II and other hardships, they are struggling to make ends meet on a meager pension. The falling ruble and rising prices have made it difficult for pensioners to afford basic necessities. Many have resorted to selling apples and relying on secondhand clothing and homegrown food. Medical care is also a challenge, as the cost of treatment is often too high. The government's response has been inadequate, offering a one-time payment instead of increasing pensions. Despite these difficulties, pensioners in Oryol have found solace in a DIY school for the elderly, where they can learn new skills and find companionship. However, they still long for a better quality of life and feel frustrated by the lack of support from the government."

Management and ownership at a Saskatoon dog kennel were warned about multiple serious problems with their animal care methods before the death of 14 large breed dogs. The kennel was warned about ventilation problems, among other issues, by a certified master trainer and kennel care expert. The SPCA also received a copy of the complaints but is unable to pursue them due to lack of power. The dogs died of heat exhaustion after a malfunction in the building's heating system caused the room they were in to become excessively hot. The kennel manager expressed remorse and stated that the upper-floor room where the deaths occurred has been closed off. The kennel will remain open. The kennel had previously received positive reviews from customers, but the trainer who raised concerns said that customers don't see the full picture. The trainer quit after management refused his suggestions and took his list of concerns to the SPCA. The SPCA is part of a coalition urging the provincial Ministry of Agriculture to reform legislation to better protect animals.

Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, was remembered at a funeral service in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The service drew hundreds of mourners and highlighted concerns about biased policing in the United States. The funeral came a day after the police officer who shot Crutcher was booked on a first degree manslaughter charge.

He was facing charges for sharing an anti-ISIS cartoon that offended Muslim groups. Hattar had been remanded in custody last month for the Facebook post, which was deemed ""blasphemous."" The cartoon was intended to criticize ISIS beliefs, but it sparked anger instead. Hattar's killing has been condemned by the government, and an investigation is underway. He was known for his controversial positions and support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition fighting ISIS."

Teach for America, an organization that recruits and trains teachers for schools serving underprivileged students, is preparing for the potential end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program under the Trump administration. The organization has 146 teachers who are not documented citizens and are protected under DACA. Viridiana Carrizales, who planned for a Trump presidency, has developed a plan to help these teachers relocate and navigate immigration issues. Teach for America got involved in immigration policy in 2012 when they lobbied for the DREAM Act. When DACA became an option in 2014, Teach for America provided resources to help aspiring teachers go through the approval process. The status of these teachers is causing concern for the organization's top executive, Elisa Villanueva Beard. Teach for America teachers with DACA status also have undocumented students in their classes and discuss these issues in a private Facebook group. Carrizales, who came to the US illegally from Mexico, worries about the 146 DACAmented teachers and their families. Despite the sadness and fear among the teachers, there is a sense of resilience and determination to come through stronger.

Two men have been arrested in connection with the stabbing death of a partygoer in Manhattan. James Rackover, a surrogate son to celebrity jeweler Jeffrey Rackover, and Lawrence Dilione have been charged with hindering prosecution, tampering with evidence, and concealing a corpse. The victim, Joseph Comunale, was stabbed 15 times and his partially burned body was found buried under a foot of earth. The motive for the attack is still under investigation, but sources suggest it may have been triggered by Comunale rejecting sexual advances. The suspects attempted to bleach the victim's blood from his clothes and used gasoline to try to burn his body. The case has shocked friends of Jeffrey Rackover, who described James as the son he never had.

A new study warns that if climate change continues, deserts in the Middle East will expand to the Mediterranean and even reach Southern Spain, transforming forests into barren lands. The study, published in the journal Science, used climate models and historical data to predict the changes in the Mediterranean if the Paris Agreement fails. Researchers found that when global warming hits 2 degrees, deserts would expand in Spain, the Near East, and North Africa. The impact of temperature changes on lands and people's lives could also affect global security. President Barack Obama has called for the development of clean energy resources to avoid conflicts and criticized climate change skeptics. He also suggested that droughts in Syria contributed to the civil war.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) released its annual global gender gap report, revealing that the US has slipped to 45th place in terms of gender equality. This decline is attributed to a decrease in women's participation in the labor force and a shrinking number of women in senior positions. However, the US has closed its education gender gap. Globally, progress towards economic equality has slowed, with the gender pay gap persisting and women's labor force participation lower than men's. The report warns that the global economic gender gap is not expected to close until 2196. The lack of progress in economic equality is concerning, as jobs typically held by women are at risk due to technological disruption. The top-ranking countries in terms of gender equality are predominantly Scandinavian. The Global Gender Gap Index ranks countries based on the distribution of resources between men and women.

Afghanistan is facing a looming humanitarian crisis as the number of displaced people continues to rise. Over a million people were already uprooted last year, and this year, at least another million Afghans are on the move within the country and across its borders. The violence and conflict in Afghanistan have forced many to flee, while others are escaping poverty and drought. The United Nations and other aid agencies are struggling to provide emergency assistance, and if they fail, it will become a full-blown crisis. The country has been plagued by massive displacement since the Soviet invasion in 1979, and the current violence is some of the worst since the Taliban was toppled. The clashes between Afghan and Taliban forces have pushed even more people from their homes. The government is unable to reach all affected areas, and the Taliban now controls more territory than at any time since 2001. The return of refugees to areas controlled by insurgents is a concern, as it could exacerbate insecurity and joblessness. The displaced are often rejected and forced into squalid camps, with limited access to clean water and food. The situation is dire, and the government is incapable of creating jobs or improving the economy in remote areas. Criminal and terrorist networks may exploit the jobless and displaced youths, further deepening the crisis.

There should be a negative stigma on using any products made with tiger parts so that people would feel ashamed to contribute to this sordid smuggling trade.	India's tiger population, which accounts for more than half of the world's total, has been rapidly declining due to human interference. While the population had been increasing in recent years, with 2,226 tigers in 2015 compared to 1,411 in 2005, this year has seen a significant increase in tiger deaths. 78 tigers have already died in the first 10 months of the year, surpassing the number of deaths in the same period over the past six years. The cause of some deaths is still being determined, but others have been attributed to human activities such as poaching, poisoning, electrocution, and road accidents. India has seized the largest number of tigers and tiger products, with 540 seizures between 2000 and 2015. The increase in tiger mortalities and seizures is a cause for concern, and experts emphasize the need for coordinated enforcement operations to combat illegal wildlife trade, which they describe as a transnational organized crime.

A suspected serial killer in Anchorage, Alaska was stopped by a police officer who was responding to a theft complaint. The officer, Arn Salao, was shot multiple times by the suspect, James Dale Ritchie, but managed to return fire and fight off his assailant. Another officer arrived at the scene and also fired at Ritchie, killing him. Ballistics tests revealed that the gun Ritchie used was the same one used in five other homicides in Anchorage in 2016. Ritchie had prior arrests for drugs and burglary and had recently returned to Alaska from West Virginia. Two of the victims linked to Ritchie's gun were identified as Jason Netter Sr. and Brianna Foisy, who were found dead in July. Another two victims, Bryant De Husson and Kevin Schuyler Turner, were found dead in August. The motive behind the killings is unknown, and it is unclear if Ritchie knew any of the victims. The police believe that the chance encounter between Officer Salao and Ritchie may have saved countless lives. Two other unsolved double homicides in Anchorage have not been linked to Ritchie.

The world's wildlife trade policy body, CITES, is calling for better treatment and tracking of illegally traded animals that are confiscated by authorities. Between 2010 and 2014, over 60,000 wild creatures were seized, with a fifth of them being threatened species. However, wildlife advocates argue that animals often suffer after being confiscated, as they are sometimes sent to inadequate facilities, returned to traffickers, or released back into the wild where they can spread diseases. CITES guidelines state that confiscated animals should be sent back to the exporting country, a designated rescue center, or other appropriate places, with humane treatment ensured. However, this doesn't always happen due to cost, impracticality, or lack of designated rescue centers. CITES member countries have agreed to distribute a questionnaire to gather information on how nations deal with confiscated animals, and Humane Society International has offered recommendations on setting up rescue centers.

An airline worker was shot and killed at Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport in a premeditated attack.

Despite significant progress in global vaccination efforts, measles still claims the lives of more than 350 children daily, according to a report by UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and other health agencies. The report emphasizes that the fight against measles is hindered not by a lack of tools or knowledge, but by a lack of political will to ensure every child is immunized. While vaccination campaigns and increased routine vaccine coverage have saved millions of lives, there are still countries where a majority of children are not vaccinated. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan account for half of all unvaccinated babies and 75% of measles-related deaths. Outbreaks of measles in various countries, caused by gaps in immunization, remain a significant problem. The report highlights the need to immunize young people who have missed out on vaccinations and notes that measles tends to resurge during conflicts or humanitarian crises.

Scottie Pippen's wife, Larsa Pippen, told police that she was scared of him during an argument at their home. The NBA star broke his own cell phone out of frustration during the altercation. This incident occurred shortly before Scottie filed for divorce. Larsa informed the police that they were having marital problems and that Scottie would raise his voice, yell, and scare her. The police report states that Scottie admitted to the argument and breaking his phone in frustration. Larsa mentioned that she would be speaking to an attorney. No arrests were made, and there were no allegations of domestic violence. Scottie's unhappiness with Larsa's relationship with Future had been a point of contention between them.

On the one-year anniversary of the Paris attacks, the city mourned the 130 people killed in the coordinated attacks. One survivor, Georges Salines, received a phone call in the middle of the night informing him that his daughter had been at the Bataclan concert hall, where 90 people were killed. The attacks have left a lasting impact on the country, with increased security measures and a rise in xenophobia. However, Parisians are determined to move forward and remember the victims. Salines and another survivor, Denys Plaud, have found solace in writing about their experiences. Salines has written a book, while Plaud returned to the Bataclan to pay his respects. Both survivors emphasize the importance of remembering the victims and living life to the fullest.

Normally an article like this might not attract my attention and cause me to read any further, but this particular forest land is home to the 3rd largest population of endangered orangutans and if the forest is cut down, it is estimated that 1750 orangutans will die or have to be rescued and re-homed. This is so heartbreaking to me because these are innocent animals, endangered ones at that, that are just living in their natural environment and have done nothing wrong.

A palm oil company named PT Mohairson Pawan Khatulistiwa plans to clear more than half of the Sungai Putri forest in Indonesia, which is home to a critically endangered orangutan population. Despite the Indonesian government's commitment to protecting peat, forests, and orangutans, the company has been granted a license to destroy the forest. The forest is at risk of being converted into an industrial tree plantation, and the company has already started work on building a drainage canal. The destruction of the forest and the orangutans' habitat is incompatible with Indonesia's national action plan for orangutans. The development violates Indonesia's legal processes and international commitments. Improved management is needed in Sungai Putri to address illegal logging and fires. There are conflicting opinions on the deforestation, with some supporting it for potential employment opportunities and compensation, while others argue that it is unsustainable. Alternative solutions that involve collaboration between various stakeholders are available to fulfill development objectives and alleviate poverty in Indonesia.

The E-Rate program, which provides subsidies for schools to enhance internet connections, has received bipartisan support and billions of dollars in funding. However, a study in North Carolina found that the program had no benefits for students and actually hurt their performance. Other research has also shown little to no gains in student achievement with improved computer access. Despite this, the program has continued to receive funding and has been plagued with fraud and lax oversight. Additionally, the push for more advanced networks and expensive technology may not be necessary, as many educational resources do not require high bandwidth connections. The funding for E-Rate comes from a tax on long distance telecommunications, which disproportionately affects lower-income households. The article suggests suspending the program until its effectiveness can be objectively tested, and exploring other options for using the funds.

The article was talking about women, especially Republican women, starting to pull away from their candidate and losing their warm and fuzzy feelings towards Trump. About time!	"Prominent Republican women are concerned that defending Donald Trump against accusations of sexual assault is damaging the party's relationship with female voters. Trump's comments about women have been a source of concern throughout his campaign, but the release of a 2005 video and subsequent allegations by 11 women have escalated the issue. Many male Republicans have come to Trump's defense, dismissing the accusers and potentially alienating female voters. This division within the party comes as polls show that women are supporting Hillary Clinton by a significant margin. Female Republican strategists and politicians, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Carly Fiorina, have distanced themselves from Trump. The recent interview between Newt Gingrich and Megyn Kelly further highlighted the party's struggle with women voters. Republican women are increasingly feeling that the party does not represent them and are critical of the party's handling of Trump's behavior. The GOP's treatment of women is playing into the ""war on women"" narrative that Democrats have pushed in the past. Trump's personal attacks on women, both in the media and on social media, have also contributed to the party's struggle with female voters. Overall, many Republican women believe that the party is not doing enough to address the concerns of female voters and that this will have negative consequences for the party in the general election."

These acts include physical harm, hate speech, and racist graffiti. Trump supporters feel empowered to express their disdain for those they dislike or deem insignificant. It is crucial for America to stand united against these attacks and promote a message of intolerance towards hate.

A recent article in the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta has sparked a national debate in Russia about the role of social media in promoting suicide among young people. The article claims that Russia's most popular social network, VKontakte (VK), has numerous groups that encourage vulnerable young people to kill themselves. The article alleges that at least 80 recent suicides can be linked to these online groups. Critics have accused the article of sensationalism and placing too much emphasis on the internet as a cause of juvenile suicide. However, the article has also prompted law enforcement agencies to launch a criminal case over groups on VK that allegedly promote suicide. Russia has one of the highest rates of youth suicide in the world, and the article has brought much-needed attention to this serious issue.

Egyptian authorities have recovered 162 bodies from a sunken migrant boat in the Mediterranean, with the death toll expected to rise to nearly 300. The boat capsized off the coast of Rosetta, carrying an estimated 450 people, mostly young Egyptian men. The number of Egyptians attempting to cross to Europe has risen sharply in the last two years, due to economic pressure and a possible shift away from Libya as a departure point. Meanwhile, China and other Asian countries are under pressure to shut down tiger farms, which supply the black market with skins, bones, and other parts. The Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has voted to ban international trade in pangolins, the most trafficked mammal on Earth. The ban aims to protect all eight species of Asian and African pangolins, which are hunted for their scales and meat. A wildfire in California's Santa Cruz Mountains has threatened hundreds of structures, with nearly 1,100 firefighters working to protect homes and communication towers. Cooler weather conditions are expected to help contain the fire.

Pakistan is expelling over 100 Turkish schoolteachers at the request of Turkey's President Erdogan. The expulsion is seen as an appeasement to Erdogan's demand to close schools linked to exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan accuses of orchestrating a coup attempt. Turkey has arrested tens of thousands of people suspected of ties to Gulen since the coup, and Erdogan has pressured other countries to aid in the crackdown. Pakistan is one of the few countries to comply. The affected schools deny any affiliation with political organizations and are petitioning against the expulsions. Over 400 Turkish citizens will have to leave Pakistan, but Erdogan reassured the students that they would not suffer.

A shooting occurred near a polling station in Azusa, California. The suspect, a Hispanic male, was found dead in a barricaded home. It is unclear if he died from police fire or if he killed himself.

Red squirrels in the UK have been found to carry leprosy, a disease that was eradicated in humans in Britain centuries ago. The squirrels were found to have two different species of leprosy bacterium, one of which is almost identical to a strain recovered from a medieval human skeleton. There is currently no evidence of squirrel-to-human transmission, but researchers are concerned about the health of the endangered red squirrels. The reason why squirrels, humans, and armadillos are the only known species to harbor the bacterium is still unknown. The discovery of leprosy in squirrels may help researchers understand how the disease manifests in humans and how it spreads.

Shelton and one of his brothers also ended up in prison later in life. The brothers were separated and moved between foster homes, with Shelton experiencing a troubled childhood and multiple incarcerations. Despite their struggles, the brothers managed to reconnect in prison, but their relationship was strained. Shelton's older brother, William, tried to support them but eventually gave up.

The artical is he US closed its education gender gap in 2016.

The annual report looks at progress towards equality between men and women in four key areas: educational attainment, health and survival, economic opportunity, and political empowerment.	The World Economic Forum (WEF) released its annual global gender gap report, revealing that the US has slipped to 45th place in terms of gender equality. This decline is attributed to a decrease in women's participation in the labor force and a shrinking number of women in senior positions. However, the US has closed its education gender gap. Globally, progress towards economic equality has slowed, with the gender pay gap persisting and women's labor force participation lower than men's. The report warns that the global economic gender gap is not expected to close until 2196. The lack of progress in economic equality is concerning, as jobs typically held by women are at risk due to technological disruption. The top-ranking countries in terms of gender equality are predominantly Scandinavian. The Global Gender Gap Index ranks countries based on the distribution of resources between men and women.

"More survivors of the Leviathan II tragedy, in which a whale-watching boat capsized and killed six people, have filed a lawsuit against the tour operator. The lawsuit describes the terrifying moments after the boat capsized, with the ship pitching and rolling in significant waves caused by a shallow reef. The captain had stopped the boat to view sea lions when a swell rose into a larger wave, causing the vessel to heel over. One of the plaintiffs, Robert Goodfellow, was submerged beneath the sea for a considerable period of time before swimming to the surface. Another plaintiff, Marya Levin, pushed a cushion towards two other passengers who were in danger of being struck by rotating propellers. Goodfellow and Levin eventually reached a lifeboat and are now seeking damages from the tour operator for physical, mental, and emotional trauma. Other survivors have also filed lawsuits, including one detailing their attempts to escape the sinking ship and a class-action suit citing post-traumatic stress disorder. The tour operator has referred to the sinking as an ""act of god."""

Maybe his golf curse has to catch fire just like the forests. This doesn't only effect us but the whole world and the life on it. United States needs to take action before it's too late.	A new study reveals that human-induced climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires in the western United States over the past 30 years. The study shows that heightened temperatures and increased aridity since 1984 have caused fires to spread across an additional 16,000 square miles, an area larger than Massachusetts and Connecticut combined. The authors warn that further warming will exponentially increase fire activity in the coming decades. The study also highlights the role of climate change in exacerbating the recent California drought and the rise in fire incidents. Factors such as a natural climate oscillation and firefighting practices have also contributed to the increase in fires. The researchers emphasize the need to prepare for larger fire years due to climate change.

The bodies of former Polish President Lech Kaczynski and his wife are being exhumed as part of a new investigation into the 2010 plane crash that killed 96 prominent Poles. The ruling party, Law and Justice, led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the late president's twin brother, has cast doubt on previous investigations and believes the crash was an assassination. They are seeking evidence against former Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who they believe had some involvement. The exhumations will involve tests to determine the cause of the crash, including checking for explosives. The exhumations are controversial, with some dismissing conspiracy theories and others upset at the violation of cultural taboos. The crash occurred while the delegation was traveling to honor Polish officers murdered by the Soviet secret police during World War II.

The reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who shot and killed a baby Salt River wild horse and wounded two others has increased to $25,000. Animal Recovery Mission, a non-profit organization, matched the existing reward fund. The Salt River Wild Horse Management Group, American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign, Humane Society of the United States, and Schill Law Firm also contributed to the reward. Despite the reward, no tips leading to the suspect's apprehension have been received. ARM Investigations, a coalition partner of the Salt River Wild Horse Management Group, decided to match the reward fund in hopes of encouraging a crucial tip. The organization fights animal cruelty and focuses on conservation programs. The witness saw a man shooting three Salt River wild horses, resulting in the death of a 6-month-old foal named Kai and injuries to two other horses. The horses are being monitored and treated by the SRWHMG. This is not the first time the wild horses of Salt River have been shot at, and the SRWHMG suspects they are being hunted. The organization is dedicated to protecting and studying the Salt River wild horses. The public can still contribute to the reward fund through a Go Fund Me page. The Maricopa Sheriff's department has not yet found any strong leads.

The war in Syria escalated as government forces and their Russian allies launched intense aerial assaults on opposition-held areas of Aleppo. The bombings killed about 100 people and knocked out running water for two million people. Efforts at the United Nations to revive a cease-fire collapsed, and hopes for humanitarian relief faded. The bombings left residents buried in debris and turned neighborhoods into rubble. The Syrian government announced a new offensive, including a ground operation, but analysts doubt their ability to seize and hold significant territory. Diplomatic efforts between Russia and the United States also disintegrated. The situation in Aleppo continues to worsen, with no end in sight.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man responsible for the bombings in Manhattan and on the Jersey Shore, had been planning the attacks for months and was inspired by international terrorists, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The complaint details the extent of the damage caused by the bombs, including shattered windows and victims with ball bearings and metal fragments in their bodies. It was also revealed that Rahami's father had previously expressed concerns to the authorities about his son's potential involvement in terrorism, but no further action was taken. Rahami's notebook, recovered after he was shot and wounded by the police, contained writings expressing his extremist Islamic ideology and admiration for terrorist figures. The complaint also mentions that Rahami had been acquiring materials for his weapons through eBay. The investigation is ongoing to determine if Rahami had any assistance in building the bombs.

A woman appeared on The Dr Phil Show to share her horrifying experience of being sexually abused by both of her parents. The victim, Amanda, revealed that her parents forced her to have sex with them and even made her pose for explicit photographs and videos to sell online. Her mother, Justine, expressed remorse for her actions and admitted to making poor choices. Both parents were charged with sexual assault and exploitation and received 20-year prison sentences. Amanda also claimed that her mother coached her sexually and was a willing participant in the abuse. Despite the trauma, Amanda's parents would continue with normal family life after the abuse. Amanda has struggled to come to terms with the fact that her parents are now out of prison. Her father, Jim, has yet to apologize to her and has been described as manipulative. Justine blamed their behavior on money, stating that Jim discovered the profitability of child pornography. The episode has sparked discussions about child abuse and pedophilia on social media, with viewers expressing their horror and disgust.

According to former Wells Fargo workers, the practice of opening unauthorized accounts to meet sales goals has been happening for much longer than the bank has admitted. The scandal, which involved the opening of as many as two million fake accounts since 2011, has led to the firing of 5,300 employees and an investigation by the Justice Department. One former branch manager, Susan Fischer, recalls being instructed to have her employees open unauthorized accounts in 2007. When she refused, she faced pressure and eventually had to take a medical leave of absence. Fischer is now speaking out to prevent this behavior from continuing.

"At least 26 Afghan civilians were killed and many others injured in airstrikes in Kunduz province, Afghanistan, while NATO and Afghan forces were fighting Taliban fighters. Two American service members also died in ground clashes. Conflicting reports on the number of casualties and no official account of the airstrikes have been provided. Some local officials claim that up to 100 civilians were killed or wounded. The incident is reminiscent of the tragic events in Kunduz last year when a U.S. airstrike mistakenly targeted a hospital, killing 42 patients and staff members. NATO officials have not confirmed the reported deaths of the civilians. Angry relatives of the victims attempted to protest, but were stopped by security forces. U.S. military officials confirmed the deaths of the two American service members and stated their commitment to helping Afghan partners defend their nation. The NATO mission in Afghanistan issued a statement referring to airstrikes by ""friendly forces"" but did not confirm any civilian casualties. The Taliban claimed that three of their fighters were targeted and killed, along with a large number of civilians."

A new study from Harvard and Columbia universities estimates that the haze from Indonesian fires last year may have caused over 100,000 premature deaths in Southeast Asia. The previous official death toll was only 19 deaths in Indonesia. The fires, set to clear land for palm oil and pulpwood plantations, occur mainly on Sumatra and Borneo, with the haze blowing over Singapore and Malaysia. The study combined satellite data with health impact models and pollution readings to estimate that 91,600 deaths occurred in Indonesia, 6,500 in Malaysia, and 2,200 in Singapore. The study only looked at health impacts on adults and the effect of fine-particulate matter, not the impact on children or other toxins produced by the fires. Last year's fires were among the worst in memory, causing widespread illness and diplomatic tensions. In other news, Samoa experienced a rare hail storm, causing disbelief among residents who thought it was a hoax. This was only the second time hail has fallen in Samoa since records began. The storm lasted 10 to 15 minutes and produced small hail stones with no reported damage. Finally, Typhoon Meranti, the strongest typhoon to hit China this year, has left 28 people dead and 15 missing in the east of the country.

The issues of communication, balancing, keeping priorities are especially importance in the relationships with your middle school children: it is critical time to form your lifelong relationship with them and, probably, it is one of the most challenging period.	A new study by Arizona State University researchers found that middle school is the most stressful time for mothers. The study involved analyzing surveys from over 2,200 well-educated moms across the country, and mothers of only middle-school-age children reported the highest levels of stress, loneliness, and emptiness. Middle school is a challenging time for children, with raging hormones, changing bodies and brains, exposure to peer pressure and risky behaviors, and a desire for independence while still feeling dependent on parents. Parents often struggle to navigate these changes and may not realize that their children still want a relationship with them. It is important for parents to listen, be supportive, and not give up during this time. Developing a strong relationship during middle school can carry into the teen years and young adulthood. Mothers should also reach out to other moms for support during this challenging time.

Many patients avoid colonoscopies due to the unpleasant preparation process, which involves drinking a salty, repulsive-tasting drink and laxative. However, a Boston-based company called ColonaryConcepts is developing bowel-clearing food bars and drinks that taste more like fruit smoothies and chocolate. These products have been tested in a phase 2 trial and have shown promising results in terms of effectiveness and patient satisfaction. The new colonoscopy prep is scheduled to begin phase 3 trials next year and could potentially enter the market in 2018. This alternative option aims to improve the tolerability and cleansing effect of the preparation process. It is important for patients to not put off colonoscopies, as they are crucial for detecting and preventing colon cancer.

A new study from the University of Washington, funded by NASA and other agencies, reveals that all 19 polar bear populations across the Arctic are facing a shorter sea ice season. The study, which is the first to quantify the sea ice changes in each polar bear subpopulation, shows a trend towards earlier sea ice melt in the spring and later ice growth in the fall. These changes negatively impact the feeding and breeding capabilities of the bears, as they rely on the sea ice for essential activities such as hunting and traveling. The study also found that the critical timing of the sea ice break-up and freeze-up is changing in all areas, which is harmful for polar bears. The researchers recommend that the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance be incorporated as measures of climate change in future reports.

Cadenbach was wanted for domestic violence and the police had been searching for him. His mother became concerned when he said he wouldn't be taken alive, so she alerted the police. An Amber Alert was issued for his two abducted sons. The police found Cadenbach in a local park and as soon as they arrived, he started shooting his children. The police tried to engage him, but he ultimately took his own life.

"The residents of Matheny Tract, a poor community in California's Central Valley, have been living with contaminated water for years. They have had to pay for bottled water in addition to their tainted tap water. However, legislation based on the ""human right to water"" is now being implemented, and Matheny Tract will be the first community to receive clean water under this law. Similar legislation has been introduced in Michigan, but is still stuck in committee. The issue of water inequality in rural communities has been brought to the forefront by the state's record-breaking drought. Many small rural systems in California have contaminated water, affecting an estimated 160,000 people. These communities often lack public investment and are overlooked by their local governments. The right to water is seen as a fundamental human right, and California's legislation is seen as a step towards addressing water inequality. The state has also introduced a publicly accessible database on water systems that are out of compliance. Matheny Tract is scheduled to receive clean water on June 1, marking a significant improvement for the community."

"A black church in Greenville, Mississippi, was set on fire and vandalized with the words ""Vote Trump"" spray painted on the side. The fire is being investigated as a hate crime, and federal authorities are assisting with the investigation. The mayor of Greenville sees this as an attack on the black church and community. The city has experienced previous acts of racism, including the word ""nigger"" being painted on a boat. Arson is difficult to prove, but in this case, the political graffiti suggests a motive.

According to an FBI report, hate crimes against Muslims in the US have increased by 67% in one year, reaching the highest number since 2001. The report also reveals a rise in hate crimes against Jewish, black, and LGBTQ individuals. These figures have been linked to President-elect Donald Trump's anti-minority rhetoric, which has fueled public anger and aggression. Experts believe that the actual number of hate crimes is likely higher than reported, and they expect the situation to worsen due to the mainstreaming of Islamophobia by Trump.

The rise in violence was driven by an increase in the murders of black men and an increase in gun murders. The number of firearm murders increased by roughly 1,500, while knife murders dropped slightly. The percentage of murders committed with guns increased to 71.5%. Despite the increase in murders, overall crime rates did not increase substantially. The attorney general mentioned the overall increase in violent crime but did not mention the increase in murders. A third of the murder increase was driven by ten larger cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Black men and women face less violence today than in the early 1990s. In a separate incident, two New Jersey Transit buses crashed in the Lincoln Tunnel, injuring as many as 44 people.

Scientists have been working on developing birth control for men, and a recent clinical trial showed promising results. However, the trial was discontinued due to side effects such as mood changes, depression, pain at the injection site, and increased libido. The article highlights the side effects of various birth control options for women, which are equally as bad but have not been halted. Women have always borne the burden of birth control, and the article argues that men should share in the responsibility. The availability of birth control has been revolutionary for women, leading to wage gains, increased college enrollment, and a decline in teen pregnancies. The article points out the double standard in the standards for male and female birth control, with women being expected to endure more side effects. The article concludes by highlighting the hypocrisy that women face in exchange for reproductive freedom.

The US-backed air campaign in Yemen has been accused of war crimes, with rights groups and UN officials stating that the coalition has disregarded civilian casualties and failed to distinguish between civilian and military targets. Nearly 4,000 civilians have been killed in the war, with 60% of them dying in airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition. The war has caused widespread hunger and displacement, and warplanes have targeted medical centers, schools, and infrastructure. The US provides intelligence and logistical help to Saudi Arabia, but has reduced the number of military personnel advising the coalition. The coalition claims to investigate violations, but critics argue that the backing from the US and international community has given them a free rein. The strike on a hospital in Abs exemplifies the problems with the airstrikes, as the hospital was on a list of sites not to be targeted and had markings to indicate it was a medical facility. The strike has had a significant impact, with Doctors Without Borders pulling its personnel from northern Yemen and leaving the Abs hospital closed. Experts argue that the strikes on the taxi and hospital constitute war crimes.

The Bramble Cay melomys, a reddish-brown rodent, recently made international news when it was declared extinct. While climate change played a role in its demise, human inaction was the ultimate cause. Rising sea levels due to climate change destroyed the melomys' habitat and food sources. However, it was revealed that Australian researchers had planned to start a captive breeding program for the melomys, but they were unable to find any individuals on Bramble Cay. This missed opportunity highlights the tragedy that had been unfolding for years. In a new paper, biologist John Woinarski and colleagues argue that the extinction of the melomys, along with two other Australian species, could have been prevented. The Christmas Island pipistrelle and Christmas Island forest skink also suffered from human neglect and inaction, allowing introduced predators to decimate their populations. Australia's biodiversity conservation law lacks explicit commitment to preventing human-caused extinctions, leaving species vulnerable. These extinctions are often overlooked due to the small size and remote locations of the species. Australia has the highest rate of mammal extinctions in the world, with 30 species lost since European colonization. Woinarski's assessment is driven by personal grief and a desire to learn from past mistakes. Australia still has over a thousand threatened and endangered species, and action is needed to prevent further extinctions. While climate change did contribute to the melomys' extinction, it is important to recognize the other environmental factors and the human choice to not save the species.

"More survivors of the Leviathan II tragedy, in which a whale-watching boat capsized and killed six people, have filed a lawsuit against the tour operator. The lawsuit describes the terrifying moments after the boat capsized, with the ship pitching and rolling in significant waves caused by a shallow reef. The captain had stopped the boat to view sea lions when a swell rose into a larger wave, causing the vessel to heel over. One of the plaintiffs, Robert Goodfellow, was submerged beneath the sea for a considerable period of time before swimming to the surface. Another plaintiff, Marya Levin, pushed a cushion towards two other passengers who were in danger of being struck by rotating propellers. Goodfellow and Levin eventually reached a lifeboat and are now seeking damages from the tour operator for physical, mental, and emotional trauma. Other survivors have also filed lawsuits, including one detailing their attempts to escape the sinking ship and a class-action suit citing post-traumatic stress disorder. The tour operator has referred to the sinking as an ""act of god."""

"A study has found that projected climate change by 2070 will occur too quickly for grass species, including wheat, corn, rice, and sorghum, to adapt. This poses a risk to the world's ability to grow enough food, as these species provide almost half of the calories consumed by humans. The grass family is not only important for diets but also for global biodiversity and ecosystems. The study compared the rates of climate change niche change in grass species with projected climate change and found a significant difference. This suggests that many grass species may disappear from certain locations. While the study did not focus on food security, it highlights the potential problems for farmers growing food crops. However, there is ongoing research to develop ""climate-proof"" food crops using wild relatives of domesticated species. Unfortunately, these wild relatives are also at risk from climate change."

Two miners initially survived the explosion, but no others were found alive. Gas explosions in mines are often caused by sparks igniting leaked gas. The State Administration of Work Safety has ordered an investigation and vowed to punish those responsible. China's mining industry has a history of being dangerous, and the country plans to close over 1,000 outdated mines to reduce overproduction.

The treatment of children in the Calais camp is not just neglectful, but abusive. The camp is in a state of hardship, with most inhabitants gone and those remaining facing constant tension and the threat of fire and bulldozers. The French authorities promised to accommodate all refugees but failed to do so, leaving many homeless. Despite detailed census information, the authorities ignored estimates and abandoned almost 2,000 refugees. Help Refugees warned that housing minors in shipping containers would expose them to danger, and now there are approximately 1,500 children subjected to these conditions. The children report lack of basic necessities such as drinking water, clean toilets, and working showers, and are only provided with one meal a day. The authorities have shown little regard for their wellbeing and have failed to safeguard them. Arbitrary security measures and restrictions on volunteers further isolate the children and cut off their access to communication and legal assistance. Many refugees are sleeping outside in the cold and rain, exposed to danger. Despite the desperate conditions, volunteers continue to provide support. Charities received notice that children in the container camp will be transferred to accommodation centers across France, but there are no guarantees and the process may take time. It is crucial for charities to ensure that refugees in France receive better care.

Airstrikes by a U.S.-backed Saudi-led coalition in the Yemeni city of Hodeidah killed at least 43 people and injured many more, according to Yemeni officials and local news reports. The strikes targeted a security complex where prisoners were being held. The city is controlled by Houthi rebels, who also control the capital and much of northern Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition claimed that the complex was being used as a command center by the rebels. The airstrikes occurred on the same day that Yemen's internationally recognized president rejected a new U.N. peace proposal. The conflict in Yemen has resulted in the deaths of over 10,000 people and has caused a humanitarian crisis in the country.

Two girls in Myanmar who were kept prisoner and tortured for five years in a tailor shop have sparked outrage and an investigation. The police had previously refused to get involved despite pleas from the girls' families. The girls, who were sent to work in the shop at the ages of 11 and 12, were denied contact with their parents, not paid, and subjected to abuse. The case highlights the issue of child slavery in Myanmar, where at least a million children are forced to give up education and work. The authorities' handling of the case has angered the public, who see it as evidence of a biased judicial system. It was only when a journalist got involved that action was taken, leading to the arrest of the tailor and her two adult children. The president has ordered a report on how the police handled the case and is taking a closer look at the work of the human rights commission. The journalist involved is receiving a presidential award for his efforts.

Donald Trump's proposed environmental policies include eliminating the EPA, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, and cutting federal spending on clean energy. Environmental groups are preparing for a fight, as these actions could have significant negative impacts on the planet. The biggest threats posed by the Trump administration include backing out of the Paris Agreement, killing the Clean Power Plan, eliminating the EPA, appointing climate change deniers to lead the EPA and Department of Energy, cutting federal spending on clean energy, avoiding regulations on methane, and opening federal lands to oil and gas drilling. However, it may be difficult for Trump to repeal and revise these regulations, and there is still hope for the planet as clean energy initiatives and pollution regulations have widespread support among the American people. Environmental organizations are prepared to fight against these policies.

Sucks we are still living  a society where woman are not created or treated fairly.	"Thousands of women in Iceland left work early to protest the gender wage gap. They gathered in Austurvollur square in Reykjavik, shouting ""Out"" to discrimination against women. The protest highlighted the 30% pay gap between men and women in Iceland. The demonstration aimed to bring attention to the issue and demand change. Despite Iceland's reputation as a gender-equal nation, progress on pay equity has been slow. The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap ranking shows that Iceland still has gaps in earned income and wages for similar work. The report also reveals that global progress towards economic parity between men and women has suffered setbacks in recent years. The gender pay gap persists due to various factors, including women entering less well-paid professions and the time it takes for employers' implicit gender biases to change. The protest in Iceland emphasizes the urgency of addressing the gender pay gap and the need for faster progress."

The battle against the Islamic State has resulted in soldiers and civilians being injured or killed by chlorine gas, mortar fire, bombs, and artillery shells. The presence of civilians in the city has made the fight more difficult for Iraqi forces and airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition. The Islamic State has been using civilians as human shields, preventing them from leaving the city. The medical station on the outskirts of Mosul is treating injured civilians, but many are unable to reach medical assistance. The fight for Mosul is expected to be prolonged, putting more civilians at risk. The Iraqi military does not release overall casualty figures, but the toll is likely much higher than reported. The battle has also caused food shortages, forcing some residents to flee. The situation is dire, with injured children and desperate pleas for help.

The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks. I agree!	Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended his surprise ban on most currency in circulation in India, which has caused chaos and inconvenience for millions of people. Modi argued that the ban was necessary to fight corruption and reduce the use of unaccounted-for cash in the country. However, opposition leaders and many citizens have criticized the move, as people have faced long lines at banks and ATMs, and many machines have run out of cash. Despite the hardships, some individuals expressed support for the ban, believing that it will ultimately benefit the nation. The transition to new currency notes has been complicated by the fact that many ATMs are not working and cannot dispense the new notes. The Finance Ministry reported that Indians have deposited about $45 billion in banned currency notes since the policy began, while banks and ATMs have given out $7.5 billion in new currency notes. The ban has had a significant impact on businesses, with sales falling and customers unable to pay with cash. While some individuals believe the ban is necessary, others argue that it is causing unnecessary suffering for the poor and that the real black money is hidden in Swiss bank accounts.

"An animal-welfare organization called Four Paws recently rescued the remaining animals from a zoo near the Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis. The zoo, known as the ""world's worst zoo,"" had a history of neglect and animal deaths, including taxidermy of dead animals. The rescue mission was complicated due to the ongoing conflict in the region, but the team successfully evacuated the animals and transferred them to sanctuaries. The rescue has been hailed as a milestone in animal rights, but concerns remain about the wider issues of wildlife trafficking and the commercialization of wild animals in Gaza. The rescued animals will now receive care and rehabilitation in their new homes. There are hopes to create new legislation in Gaza to address these issues and prevent animal smuggling. The organization is also concerned about other zoos in conflict zones that require immediate attention."

A new study warns that if climate change continues, deserts in the Middle East will expand to the Mediterranean and even reach Southern Spain, transforming forests into barren lands. The study, published in the journal Science, used climate models and historical data to predict the changes in the Mediterranean if the Paris Agreement fails. Researchers found that when global warming hits 2 degrees, deserts would expand in Spain, the Near East, and North Africa. The impact of temperature changes on lands and people's lives could also affect global security. President Barack Obama has called for the development of clean energy resources to avoid conflicts and criticized climate change skeptics. He also suggested that droughts in Syria contributed to the civil war.

Over 14,000 Saudi women have signed a petition calling for an end to the country's male guardianship system, which requires women to have the consent of a male guardian for various activities. The campaign gained support online through a trending Twitter hashtag. Women in Saudi Arabia must obtain permission from a male relative for activities such as traveling, working, studying, and even leaving the country. The petition was delivered to the government, and the activists are awaiting a response. The male guardianship system also affects women's ability to rent a flat, seek medical treatment, or file a legal claim. The campaign has received an incredible response, with hundreds of women bombarding the Saudi King's office with telegrams supporting the cause. However, there is opposition from some Saudi women who argue for reforming the system. The activists are demanding that women be treated as full citizens and that an age between 18 and 21 be designated as the point at which a woman is considered an adult. There has been no official response to the petition yet.

The Pilcomayo River in Paraguay is experiencing an extensive die-off of caiman, fish, and other river creatures due to a combination of drought and mismanagement. Up to 98% of caimans and 80% of capybaras are suspected dead. The river has dried up for nearly 435 miles and the government has declared an environmental emergency. The mismanagement of water resources and infrastructure by both Paraguay and Argentina has exacerbated the crisis. The river's wandering behavior and the significant amount of sediment it transports downstream have contributed to the blockage and dispersal of the river outside its channel. The government is working to find a solution, but there is no water to release or divert. Zimbabwe plans to sell its wildlife, including elephants and possibly endangered African wild dogs, to replenish its coffers due to cash shortages and a drought. Critics argue that the mismanagement of the economy and lack of accountability make this plan unworkable. South Australia has been hit by a destructive storm just 24 hours after a super cell thunderstorm knocked out the state's entire power network.

Justin Ross Harris, a man from Georgia, is on trial for leaving his infant son to die in a hot car. Prosecutors argue that Harris left his son in the car for seven hours because he was pursuing extramarital affairs. Defense attorneys admit Harris's philandering but argue that his son's death was a tragic accident. The fate of Harris is now in the hands of the jurors. The trial has gained significant publicity, leading to the proceedings being moved 300 miles away. Harris faces charges of malice murder, felony murder, and cruelty to children. The prosecution emphasized Harris's illicit chats with women, including underage girls, on the day of his son's death. The defense argues that Harris's sexual behavior is unrelated to the death. The prosecution highlighted the position of the car seat as evidence that Harris could see his son. The defense claims that the investigation was biased and misled the jurors.

Using air pollution as a reason for mental health issues is weird.	A new study from Umeå University in Sweden found that high rates of air pollution are linked to poorer psychiatric health in children and adolescents. The researchers examined register-based data on individuals under 18 from different regions in Sweden and found that air pollution levels do impact psychiatric diagnoses in young people. The risk of having at least one psychiatric diagnosis increased with a 10 microgram per cubic meter increase in nitrogen dioxide levels in the air. Nitrogen dioxide is a harmful air pollutant that results from road traffic and fossil fuel use. Long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide has been associated with reduced lung function, respiratory problems, and increased allergy rates.

This means that a significant number of chickens likely experience intense suffering when they are killed. The lack of regulations governing the humane slaughter of chickens in the U.S. has allowed poultry companies to prioritize meat quality over ensuring that chickens are reliably stunned. Animal protection groups are pressuring companies to phase out the use of electric water-baths and adopt alternative methods, such as controlled atmosphere killing. Gas stunning systems are considered more humane and produce better meat quality. The current process of slaughtering chickens also causes them stress and pain, with many experiencing broken bones and wing damage. The U.S. Agriculture Department estimates that hundreds of thousands of birds are unintentionally boiled alive each year. Animal welfare groups are campaigning to improve conditions for broiler chickens and some companies, like Perdue Farms, have pledged to install gas stunning systems in their facilities.

The economic crisis in Venezuela has led to a shortage of food, affecting both people and animals. Around 50 animals at Caricuao Zoo have starved in the last six months due to the rising cost of food caused by the economic downturn. The country's inability to import food and other necessities, along with skyrocketing inflation, has led to widespread hunger. Zoo staff have resorted to feeding carnivorous animals fruits and vegetables, and even slaughtered horses. The malnourishment of animals can have long-lasting health effects, including psychological issues. Other zoos in Venezuela are also struggling to feed their animals and are seeking donations. The situation in Venezuela is not unique, as animals in other countries, such as Gaza and Yemen, are also suffering due to poor social climates and conflicts. Animal rights organizations are working to address these issues and provide assistance to the affected animals.

The exact number of bodies and cause of death is unknown, but investigators believe that many more burial sites will be found as Iraqi forces continue to retake territory from ISIS. The bodies found in this grave had been dumped on piles of trash, with some showing signs of being bound and blindfolded. Locals reported that ISIS fighters had been rounding up former members of Iraqi security forces in the area. A UN human rights organization stated that ISIS recently abducted 295 former Iraqi security forces members and forced 1,500 families to retreat with them to the Mosul airport, potentially using them as human shields.

A study published in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery reveals that one in ten Americans suffer from tinnitus, a persistent buzzing or ringing in the ears. The study found that tinnitus is connected to hearing loss and is often not discussed with doctors. The research also shows that higher rates of tinnitus are reported in individuals with consistent exposure to loud noises, either at work or during recreational activities. Treatment options include hearing aids and psychotherapy to change the way affected individuals think about tinnitus.

It highlights the prevalence of gun deaths in the country, particularly among black children, and the lack of attention given to these deaths compared to mass shootings. The text also explores the stories of the children who were killed and the circumstances surrounding their deaths. It concludes by discussing the need for gun control in America and the impact of the Second Amendment on the issue.

The Cavendish banana, which is the most widely sold banana in the Western world, is facing the threat of extinction due to its vulnerability to diseases. The previous popular variety, Gros Michel, was wiped out by a fungal disease called Fusarium wilt. The Cavendish replaced it but is now susceptible to a disease called Black Sigatoka. Additionally, a new strain of Fusarium wilt called Tropical Race 4 (TR4) is spreading and could devastate the banana industry. To combat these diseases, scientists are studying the genetics of wild banana varieties and banana pathogens to find resistant genes. However, there has been little effort and funding for this research. By increasing genetic diversity in cultivated bananas, the industry can reduce its vulnerability to diseases. Scientists have already identified the genome sequences of bananas and the fungi causing the diseases, which provides a basis for identifying disease-resistant genes. With the use of genetic engineering and plant breeding, these genes can be transferred into desired cultivars. It is crucial to increase the pool of genetic diversity in cultivated bananas to avoid repeating the history of the Gros Michel and Cavendish varieties.

Kesha revealed in an interview with The New York Times magazine that she was under immense pressure to maintain a party girl image and dumb down her music while working with her former producer, Dr. Luke. She also stated that she was pressured to starve herself, which led her to check into a treatment center for eating disorders in 2014. Kesha has been open about her struggles with body image and has since taken steps towards reinvention. However, Dr. Luke's lawyer released a statement claiming that Kesha's allegations are false and part of a press campaign to mislead the public. The lawyer also stated that Kesha had the freedom to release music but chose not to until recently.

"This year is on track to be the warmest on record, and if carbon emissions continue to rise, record hot years will become the ""new normal"" by 2025. The damage has already been done, and the global average temperature of 2015 will be the norm by 2040. Extreme seasons will become the norm within decades if emissions continue as usual. However, there is still hope to prevent record-breaking heat at a seasonal and regional level with immediate action on carbon emissions. The Paris climate agreement's proposed emissions cuts are not enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. To keep global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius, emissions need to be slashed by an additional 25 percent by 2030. Despite concerns about President-elect Donald Trump's stance on climate change, world leaders and activists remain committed to battling climate change."

"Azealia Banks tearfully shared her side of the Russell Crowe incident in a new interview. She described the argument that led to her being kicked out of Crowe's hotel room as ""humiliating."" Banks claimed that Crowe made disparaging comments about her career, and when she responded, the whole table turned against her. She alleged that Crowe called her the N-word, choked her, and physically removed her from the suite. However, a source close to Crowe denied these claims and stated that he acted in defense of his guests. Banks also expressed disappointment that RZA, who invited her to the party, did not stand up for her. RZA later contradicted Banks' narrative and accused her of threatening someone with a glass. Despite the backlash, Banks remains resilient and confident in her youth and music career."

"In South Africa, private security companies are training anti-poaching guards to protect rhinos from poachers. The demand for rhino horns, which are used in traditional medicine and high-end ornaments, has led to a spike in poaching. The South African government has declared rhino poaching a ""national priority crime"" and has implemented initiatives to combat the problem. Private rhino owners have spent millions of dollars on security measures, but the fight against poaching remains challenging. The security industry plays a crucial role in protecting rhinos on private game reserves, but there are concerns about the escalating conflict and the potential for violence. Some believe that more focus should be placed on education and awareness to address the root causes of poaching."

Iraqi Christians who were brutalized by the Islamic State and betrayed by their neighbors doubt they will ever be able to return to Mosul. The advance of the Islamic State scattered religious and ethnic minorities in the area, and the future of the region will be defined by who decides to return. While some villagers express hope in rebuilding and staying, others believe the area is lost and will only get worse. Iraq's news media has been showing images of soldiers recapturing desecrated churches, implying that it will soon be safe for Christians to return. However, Christians have been leaving Iraq for years, and community leaders say it will be difficult to go back to Mosul due to the pain and threats they experienced. Many Christians who do return would likely only do so to sell their houses and leave.

Jewish communities in the United States are grappling with fear, grief, and anger following Donald Trump's election as president. Synagogues across the country have held prayer and healing services to address these emotions. While Jews have not been directly insulted by Trump, they fear that his presidency will create a hostile environment for minority groups. The Jewish community is overwhelmingly liberal and Democratic, leading to a sense of alienation from their fellow Americans. However, they also recognize the need for understanding and reaching out to Trump supporters. Jews are urged to reflect on their own actions and allyship with other marginalized groups. This new era has brought about a struggle for Jews to understand Trump supporters while maintaining their own values and finding solidarity with others.

The US presidential election has led to a surge in calls to crisis and suicide prevention hotlines. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline received a significant increase in calls, with the volume being two to three times higher than usual. The Crisis Text Line also experienced a surge in texts, with eight times the normal volume. The Trevor Project, which provides support to LGBTQ youth, saw a doubling of call volume, with more than 95% of callers discussing the election. The Trans Lifeline, which supports the transgender community, has been flooded with calls since the election, receiving more than 500 calls a day. The election results have caused panic and fear among callers, particularly regarding the potential loss of insurance and trans-affirming healthcare. These crisis hotlines are urging people to support each other, get back to routines, and limit exposure to media that exacerbates feelings of hopelessness. Acts of kindness and compassion are also encouraged to help alleviate anxiety.

Two American sisters, Robin Korkki and Anne Korkki, were found unresponsive in their resort in the Seychelles and later pronounced dead. Autopsies revealed that they died from acute pulmonary edema, or excess fluid in the lungs, with Anne also having excess fluid in the brain. The cause of the fluid buildup is still unknown, and toxicology analysis is being conducted. No visible injuries were found on the bodies. The sisters' family is seeking answers and some members have traveled to the Seychelles to gather details and bring the bodies home. The Seychelles is a popular tourist destination known for its beaches and coral reefs. The sisters arrived on September 15 and were scheduled to leave on September 24.

Somehow we have to figure out better relief efforts for natural disasters.	A month after Hurricane Matthew hit southwestern Haiti, the region is facing widespread hunger and destruction. At least 800,000 people urgently need food, but there is not enough aid reaching the affected areas. Truckloads of food and medical supplies have been looted, and desperate crowds have clashed with police. The storm destroyed homes, crops, and livestock, leaving many without shelter or a means to survive. Cholera outbreaks are also occurring due to contaminated water supplies. The United Nations has only raised one-third of the emergency funding needed to help the affected population. The Haitian government, along with international relief organizations, is coordinating efforts to provide assistance, but political obstacles and the upcoming elections pose challenges. The situation is dire, with people sleeping under trees and lacking basic necessities. The destruction is so severe that some remote mountain villages may not receive aid until the end of November.

Fortunately, there is Human Rights Watch which has done extensive and careful documentation of the most recent school bombing, and there is some effort to get individual acts treated as war crimes through UN channels.	An investigation by Human Rights Watch has concluded that the deadly attack on a school in Syria was carried out by Syrian regime and Russian warplanes. Russia initially denied that any airstrikes had taken place, but satellite imagery and drone footage released by the Russian Ministry of Defence showed damage consistent with HRW's evidence. HRW has compiled video evidence and witness testimonies, and called on Russia to conduct a thorough investigation. This attack is one of many targeting civilian infrastructure in Syria, with over 4,200 schools damaged or destroyed during the six-year war. Efforts are being made to establish culpability for war crimes committed in Syria through the UN General Assembly and national courts in Europe and the United States.

Doctors just tell patients to lose weight and rush them out of the office. Not that the rest of us are protected from medical protocols that are outdated and sometimes harmful, either. What to do?	The healthcare system in the United States is ill-prepared to treat obese patients, with doctors often unwilling to look past their weight and provide proper care. Obese patients face difficulties ranging from inadequate equipment to biased attitudes from healthcare providers. Doctors may spend less time with obese patients, fail to refer them for diagnostic tests, and attribute symptoms to their weight without investigating other causes. The lack of appropriate medical care for obese patients extends to treatments, with drug doses often not calibrated for obese patients and surgeons refusing to perform joint replacements unless the patient loses weight. The situation is further complicated by the fear of medical professionals of being penalized for complications and poor outcomes. The article also discusses the challenges faced by doctors and therapists in providing medical care to transgender patients due to limited knowledge and bias. The Mexican government's investigation into the disappearance of 43 college students in 2014 remains unsolved, leading many to question its ability and willingness to find answers.

The article highlights the stories of three survivors of the attacks in Iguala, Mexico, who continue to seek justice and fight for their rights.

Keith Springer, an expert in killing small animals, is on a mission to eradicate an army of house mice that are endangering a remote colony of seabirds on Gough Island.

Springer is working on an audacious plan to spray poison pellets from helicopters to kill the mice, but the operation is challenging and expensive. A campaign is underway to raise funds for the eradication project. If successful, the plan will save the seabirds and allow a new generation of albatrosses to thrive.

It is hard to see which side has the more valid argument over the other since everyone involved is so passionate about their side of it all.	A new study in Science reveals that global warming has already affected every aspect of life on Earth, from genes to entire ecosystems. With just a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, major impacts are already being felt in natural systems. More than 80% of ecological processes that support healthy marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems show signs of responses to climate change. These impacts have consequences for humans, including increased pests and disease outbreaks, unpredictable changes in fisheries, and decreasing agriculture yields. Understanding the adaptive capacity in nature can help address these issues and apply the same principles to crops, livestock, and aquacultural species. The study emphasizes the need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as there are already significant and widespread impacts from climate change across biological systems.

The falling ruble and rising prices have made it difficult for pensioners to afford basic necessities. Many have resorted to selling apples and relying on secondhand clothing and homegrown food. Medical care is also a challenge, as the cost of treatment is often too high. The government's response has been inadequate, offering a one-time payment instead of increasing pensions.

Now, earning a living in the U.S. is proving difficult for younger generations. Donald Trump’s crusade against immigrants	The large Somali community in Minneapolis went through a rigorous screening process to enter the US, but younger generations are struggling to earn a living. Donald Trump's anti-immigrant stance is based on a false notion that the country's safety is at risk from Muslim extremists due to lax vetting policies. In reality, refugees face a lengthy screening process by the United Nations before coming to the US. However, once in the country, they receive limited support in terms of job-search help and cash assistance, making it difficult for them to integrate into the American economy. This lack of support contributes to refugee families' difficulty in escaping poverty and younger generations' sense of isolation.

The closure will affect hundreds of thousands of students and over 8,000 employees. ITT blamed the closure on the actions and sanctions from the Department of Education, which barred the company from enrolling new students using federal financial aid. The company has been found to be out of compliance with accreditor standards twice this year. For-profit colleges like ITT Tech have been criticized for charging high tuition fees without providing a valuable education. Some students may be eligible to have their federal student loans discharged and transfer their credits to another institution. This closure follows a similar situation with Corinthian Colleges in 2015.

The Russian defense ministry released drone footage showing a pickup truck carrying militants and a heavy mortar driving alongside the convoy before it was bombed.

The US accused the Syrian government and Russia of violating the ceasefire, while Moscow accused the US-led coalition of aiding ISIS. The incident highlights the deep mistrust between the superpowers and the failure to achieve a lasting agreement to end the conflict.

The woman, 25, reported being attacked by two U.K. men last month, but instead of being treated as a victim, she was locked up and charged. She is currently on bail but cannot leave the country and needs $30,000 for legal fees. The men have returned to Birmingham, while the woman fears a long jail term for violating the United Arab Emirates' Sharia laws on sex. Her passport has been taken, and she is staying with an English family. The incident occurred during her dream adventure after leaving her IT consultancy career. The victim's family claims that the men took turns raping her while filming the assault. In the UAE, sex outside marriage is prohibited for couples, and single individuals are forbidden from having sex with married individuals. The victim's marital status is unclear.

President and Mr. Donald Trump feels that the Confederate Flag should be placed in a museum. That course of action is an intelligent response, for both sides of the issue. I agree.	The Confederate battle flag, a divisive symbol, has resurfaced in the context of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign and his supporters. The flag has been displayed at Trump rallies and used as a response to anti-Trump protests. The flag's resurgence raises questions about race relations under Trump and the influence of his campaign on white resentment and white nationalism. Historians note that the flag has had shifting meanings over time, representing white resistance to integration during the Civil Rights era and now symbolizing concerns about the displacement of white culture. While some Trump supporters argue that the flag represents heritage, others acknowledge that it has been hijacked by hate groups. Reports of discrimination and hate crimes targeting minorities have increased since the election, with many incidents invoking Trump and his campaign slogans. The flag's new context is perplexing to some Southerners who view it as a symbol of Southern sacrifice rather than a political statement.

Especially in the areas of unemployment, on average when someone is having problems finding gainful employment, they will move to another location for work reasons alone, and nothing to do with a natural disaster as Louisiana is faced with.	The flood-ravaged state of Louisiana may face a population loss as residents consider leaving after the flood waters recede. While few people have confirmed their departure, it is a topic of discussion among many. The state's economy will suffer if there is a decline in population, as it will reduce spending and tax revenue. Louisiana experienced a 6% population decrease after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, taking over five years to recover. Although this year's exodus is unlikely to be as severe, the shortage of available housing and the closure of small businesses due to the flooding pose challenges. Additionally, the decline in oil industry jobs and the state's high unemployment rate further complicate the situation. The aid and insurance money that typically accompanies natural disasters may not be enough to prevent people from leaving, exacerbating an already struggling economy.

The majority of these casualties were caused by airstrikes from a coalition led by Saudi Arabia. At least 329 civilians have been killed and 426 injured since the beginning of August. Saudi Arabia and its allies are trying to prevent an international investigation into possible war crimes. The United States and Britain, major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia, are finding it harder to ignore the bloodshed. The most recent example of the carnage was an airstrike on a market and residential area in Hodeidah, which killed at least 26 civilians. The United Nations has documented numerous attacks on civilian facilities by both coalition and rebel forces. Doctors Without Borders has pulled staff members out of six hospitals in Yemen after coalition planes bombed a facility. The United Nations has also expressed concern over the blockade of the city of Taiz, which has left residents critically short of food and water. The majority of civilian casualties have been caused by the Saudi-led coalition, according to a report to the Human Rights Council. Saudi Arabia and President Hadi's government have condemned the report as biased and have proposed a Yemeni commission to investigate human rights violations. Rights groups argue that a national body lacks expertise and that its reporting falls short of international standards. The European Union has drafted a competing resolution calling for a United Nations mission to Yemen. The Council will decide how to proceed after a week of diplomatic negotiations. President Hadi accused Iran of blocking the path towards peace in Yemen.

The lack of rain and snow has caused reservoirs to reach record lows, rivers to dwindle, and lakes to disappear. The drought has had devastating effects on the Native American tribes in Nevada, such as the Yomba Reservation, where ranchers have been forced to sell off their herds. The drought not only has ecological and economic impacts but also sociological and psychological ones, leading to domestic violence, substance abuse, and a sense of displacement. The article also mentions the importance of preserving native cultures and the efforts being made to help tribal communities survive the drought.

At least 239 migrants are believed to have drowned in two shipwrecks off the coast of Libya this week, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Survivor accounts suggest that two overcrowded boats broke up just off the Libyan coast on Wednesday. The 31 survivors were taken to the Italian island of Lampedusa. If true, these shipwrecks bring the toll of dead and missing in the Mediterranean to 4,220 this year, the highest on record. Most of the migrants appear to have come from sub-Saharan Africa. The European Union is conducting a search-and-rescue operation in the western Mediterranean, but the focus remains on deterrence rather than protection. The shifting migration patterns have been a boon to smugglers, as demand has increased across the trickier North African route.

A survey conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA) found that 52% of Americans consider the 2016 Presidential Election to be a significant source of stress. This stress is not limited to any particular political party and is exacerbated by social media posts, which can range from factual to inflammatory. Additionally, 38% of adults say that cultural and political discussions on social media cause them stress. The APA has provided a list of do's and don'ts for reading and reacting to election news. The stress trend is expected to continue until mid-November, as more people rely on online sources for news. While cable TV news remains the top source of election news, more millennials are turning to alternative sources for information.

I had no idea that Zika was discovered in 1947 and that there was an outbreak in 2007. As far as I knew, it was only the very recent outbreak that Zika was discovered. How wrong I was. It was actually really heartening to read this, because I want to start a family in the next few years and I was practically twitching with anxiety.

It is good to know that it comes in and out of viral ""fashion"" and that there is a herd immunity aspect to it. Maybe I can put down the mosquito shotgun for now and aim for a slightly stronger spray for my clothing."	The future of the Zika virus is uncertain. Experts have different opinions on how long it will stick around and how often it will return. Some believe it will behave like other arboviruses, recurring regularly with upticks in cases during the rainy season. Others predict that it will vanish in a few years, similar to chikungunya. The current outbreak in the Americas is due to the fact that people in the region had no immunity to the virus. Future outbreaks may be smaller if people develop immunity, but there could also be long lulls between outbreaks, allowing for a buildup of younger people who aren't immune. It is unclear if there will be fewer cases of microcephaly in the future due to the immunity gained from Zika infections. The impact of mosquito control efforts on young girls getting infected is also uncertain. It is unknown if Zika will strike Africa and Asia with the same ferocity as the Americas, but experts believe the two strains of Zika will be cross-protective. The uncertainty surrounding Zika's future affects the prospects for a vaccine. If Zika activity subsides, it will be difficult to conduct clinical trials to prove the vaccine's effectiveness. However, the fear of the virus's impact on developing fetuses may continue to drive demand for a vaccine.

A BBC Scotland investigation has revealed the difficulties faced by ageing timeshare owners who want to get out of their contracts. Sellmytimeshare.tv, owned by Monster, claims to help dispose of timeshares, but an undercover investigation found it to be more complicated than advertised. Timeshares, marketed as a hassle-free lifetime of holidays, are owned by around 600,000 people in the UK. A retired couple from Alva in Clackmannanshire have been trying to relinquish their timeshare contracts for two years due to health issues and difficulty in finding affordable travel insurance.

Wind turbines are not only killing local birds, but also birds from hundreds of miles away, according to researchers from Purdue University and the U.S. Geological Survey. Using DNA and stable isotopes, the researchers found that golden eagles killed at a wind farm in California can come from far distances. This raises concerns about the impact of wind farms on bird populations. The Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) in California, one of the oldest and largest wind farms in the world, has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of birds. The researchers found that eagles are attracted to the area due to the abundance of prey and the windy conditions, but fail to see the turbine blades and get hit. The study also revealed that a large percentage of the birds killed are from neighboring states, highlighting the need for environmental assessments to consider the impact on the entire population. The findings have implications for the management of wind energy facilities and the conservation of bird species.

Since so many people do not care about the environment or do not know the effects of harming the environment, how about you and see set up some program that would help improve the environment?	A study published in Plos One reveals that Americans waste a significant amount of food, with about 133 billion pounds of edible food going uneaten in 2010. Two-thirds of this waste is attributed to consumers. The paper highlights the negative environmental impact of food waste, as 95% of it ends up in landfills. Ohio State University professor Brian Roe suggests that increasing awareness of the issue can lead to purposeful action to reduce food waste. A national survey conducted last year found that 53% of Americans are aware of the problem, a 10% increase from a previous study. The survey also revealed that many people believe throwing away food after the package date reduces the risk of food-related illnesses and that some food waste is necessary for freshness. Additionally, 77% of respondents feel guilty about wasting food, while 58% understand the environmental consequences. However, 51% believe it is difficult to reduce home food waste, and 42% claim to lack the time to address the issue.

"Environmental health officers are calling for a smoking ban in playgrounds, zoos, and other areas where children play. The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health wants local councils to designate these areas as smoking exclusion zones to reduce the chances of children thinking that smoking is normal. The ban would also protect children from secondhand smoke. A recent poll showed that 89% of adults surveyed support a ban on smoking in children's play areas. Some councils have already implemented voluntary bans in certain outdoor places. Forest, a smokers' rights group, criticized the proposal, calling it ""Orwellian."" The smoking ban in enclosed public places has been in effect in the UK since 2007."

A mass grave containing the bodies of hundreds of Iraqi policemen who were executed by ISIS has been discovered near Mosul. The grave was found by Iraqi security forces during their assault on the ISIS stronghold. The bodies are believed to have been buried as recently as October, just before the US-backed forces began their assault on Mosul. The grave was visited by Human Rights Watch, who found four exposed corpses and piles of rubbish covering other bodies. Witnesses reported that ISIS rounded up around 2,000 people from the area and forced them to head towards Mosul, separating the former policemen and driving them away. Gunfire and screams were heard on multiple occasions, indicating further executions. Human Rights Watch has called for ISIS to be held accountable for these crimes against humanity.

However, the trial was discontinued due to side effects such as mood changes, depression, pain at the injection site, and increased libido. The article highlights the side effects of various birth control options for women, which are equally as bad but have not been halted. Women have always borne the burden of birth control, and the article argues that men should share in the responsibility. The availability of birth control has been revolutionary for women, leading to wage gains, increased college enrollment, and a decline in teen pregnancies. The article points out the double standard in the standards for male and female birth control, with women being expected to endure more side effects. The article concludes by highlighting the hypocrisy that women face in exchange for reproductive freedom.

Airstrikes by a U.S.-backed Saudi-led coalition in the Yemeni city of Hodeidah killed at least 43 people and injured many more, according to Yemeni officials and local news reports. The strikes targeted a security complex where prisoners were being held. The city is controlled by Houthi rebels, who also control the capital and much of northern Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition claimed that the complex was being used as a command center by the rebels. The airstrikes occurred on the same day that Yemen's internationally recognized president rejected a new U.N. peace proposal. The conflict in Yemen has resulted in the deaths of over 10,000 people and has caused a humanitarian crisis in the country.

At least 55 people have died and dozens are missing after a boat carrying migrants capsized off the coast of Egypt. The boat, which was overcrowded with up to 450 migrants, sank near the city of Rosetta. So far, 163 survivors have been rescued and four suspected human traffickers have been arrested. The search for more survivors will focus on the boat's cold storage room, where witnesses say around 100 people were trapped. This incident highlights the dangerous journey that migrants are taking to reach Europe, with Egypt becoming an increasingly popular departure point. The UN refugee agency predicts that this year will be the deadliest on record for the Mediterranean.

A new study conducted in California has found that lung cancer patients exposed to air pollution may have shorter survival times. The research focused on California due to its wide range of air pollution levels and extensive air quality monitoring network. The study found that patients in areas with high levels of fine particulate matter had a median survival time of only 2.4 years, compared to 5.7 years in areas with lower pollution levels. Lung cancer patients whose cancer had spread to other parts of their bodies had shorter survival times overall, regardless of air pollution levels. The researchers suggest that newly diagnosed lung cancer patients should consider moving out of areas with high levels of air pollution. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in America, according to the CDC.

They tend to adjust their position so they can see things better as they age. The younger bonobos sit close to their partner when they groom but the older ones sit ridiculously far away. I wouldn't even think their arms could reach when I read the distance was over a foot.	Aging bonobos have been found to develop farsightedness, similar to humans. Instead of using glasses, they adjust their position when grooming to compensate for their deteriorating eyesight. Researchers observed that older bonobos sat back and extended their arms farther than younger bonobos, and this behavior increased over time. This shift in position is believed to be an adaptation to their declining vision. The study compared grooming distances of 14 wild bonobos between the ages of 11 and 45. The findings could provide insights into human aging and the impact of evolutionary heritage on age-related deterioration.

The flooding has caused significant destruction to homes, infrastructure, and power systems in the country's Northeastern Hamgyong province. At least 133 people have been killed and nearly 400 are missing. The government has redirected its loyalty campaign to assist those affected. This public admission of needing help is rare for North Korea. The international community is being called upon to respond to the disaster. This comes after North Korea's fifth nuclear test, which was met with international condemnation.

Germany, which took in more asylum seekers than the rest of Europe combined, is facing the challenge of deciding who gets to stay. Syrians and Iraqis are almost guaranteed sanctuary, while Nigerians and Pakistanis are more likely to have their claims rejected. Even Syrians are increasingly falling short of winning full refugee status. Critics argue that asylum officials are turning a deaf ear to genuine petitions from asylum seekers arriving from countries outside the Middle East war zones. The German government is increasingly targeting migrants deemed ineligible for protection and is enforcing deportation more strictly. The system is flawed, with many appeals against the Federal Office's decisions and concerns about inexperienced decision-makers and declining interpreter quality.

The mental health care provided to detainees at Guantánamo Bay has been compromised by a lack of training, ethical boundaries, and information about their treatment during interrogations. Psychiatrists and psychologists were often unaware of the abuse that had taken place, and were discouraged from asking detainees about their experiences. The quality of care has been criticized by human rights groups and defense teams, who argue that it has been negligent and ineffective. Many detainees suffer from psychological problems as a result of their treatment, but PTSD is rarely diagnosed due to the impracticality of treatment in the prison environment. The mental health personnel faced numerous challenges, including distrust from detainees and the blurred lines between medical care and interrogation. Despite these obstacles, they did their best to provide care to the prisoners.

The infections, caused by a species of bacteria called Elizabethkingia anophelis, have killed 15 people and sickened 33 others. The microbe is resistant to common antibiotics, making treatment difficult. The outbreak is unusual because the bacteria is typically found in hospitals, but many of the infected individuals have not had recent contact with healthcare facilities. Investigators are testing various products for contamination as a possible source. The outbreak is challenging to understand as little is known about Elizabethkingia. The bacteria is commonly found in soil and mosquitoes, and it thrives in moist biofilms. Previous outbreaks have been linked to contaminated taps in hospitals. The current outbreak is the first reported of this particular species of Elizabethkingia. Officials believe it is unlikely that the contamination comes from tap or groundwater, but the source remains unknown.

A man is suing Royal Caribbean after his husband fell overboard during a Caribbean cruise and died. The lawsuit claims that the cruise line failed to make a timely attempt to save him or recover his body. The husband alleges that they were subjected to homophobic taunts and slurs from crewmembers before the incident. The argument escalated, and the husband fell off the stateroom balcony, landing on a lifeboat before falling into the ocean. The complaint states that security officers failed to secure and rescue him. The Coast Guard performed a search-and-rescue operation, but the body was never found. The husband is seeking compensatory damages for negligence and emotional distress.

"Russia launched a major air offensive in Syria, targeting the rebel-held part of Aleppo just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with President-elect Donald Trump about their goals for ending the Syria crisis. The strikes were described as ongoing and were carried out by Russian Navy frigates and fighter jets. The Pentagon called the missile launches a ""show"" and stated that Russia already had enough firepower in Syria to cause serious damage. The Obama administration has been trying to negotiate a cease-fire in Aleppo for months, but the situation remains dire, with the city under siege and no aid allowed in since July. In addition to the military offensive, a joint report by the World Food Program and the Food and Agricultural Organization stated that food production in Syria has reached an all-time low, threatening to drive more people from their homes."

Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, is facing a tough re-election fight after years of comfortable victories. His decision to embrace Donald Trump has worsened his chances of winning. His opponent, Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel, has received significant financial support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Issa has tried to fight back by highlighting accusations made against Applegate by his former wife. In another California district, Representative Jeff Denham is also facing a tough re-election fight. Denham, like Issa, has expressed support for Trump. Both districts have a large and growing Latino population, which is expected to vote against Trump. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC have invested over $4 million to defeat Issa and Denham. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, has given over $1.6 million to Denham. Denham's refusal to disavow Trump has put him at odds with the editorial board of The Modesto Bee, the largest newspaper in his district, which has endorsed his opponent, Michael Eggman.

Dahir Ahmed Adan, a 20-year-old Somali refugee, was identified as the suspect in the stabbing spree at a Minnesota mall. He allegedly stabbed 10 people before being shot dead by an off-duty police officer. Adan was wearing a private security uniform and asked at least one person if they were Muslim while carrying out the stabbings. Although an ISIS-affiliated media outlet claimed responsibility, there is no evidence linking Adan to the terrorist group. Adan was described as a quiet and studious young man from a well-known local Somali family. He had recently called his soccer coach for weight-loss advice and was out of work after his part-time security guard job ended. Investigators are examining Adan's media accounts and electronic devices to determine his motive. Minnesota has the largest Somali community in the US, and community leaders expressed concern about potential backlash. The Somali community in Minnesota has been targeted by ISIS for recruitment, with several individuals convicted or charged with supporting the extremist group.

Many of them are facing difficult circumstances, including food and medicine shortages, as well as neglect from their families. The siege imposed by pro-government forces has made it nearly impossible to find medicine to treat chronic diseases commonly experienced by older people. Overstretched medical facilities are unable to provide proper care, leading to more deaths. Some families have even abandoned their older family members due to the extreme conditions. The situation has left many older residents feeling weak, frightened, and helpless. Despite the dangers, some refuse to leave their homes, while others are trapped and unable to leave due to the siege. The older residents of Aleppo are struggling to balance their own needs with the demands of their families, often sacrificing their own well-being. The war has taken away their dignity and left them feeling isolated and afraid.

Officer Betty Jo Shelby claimed she feared for her life when Terence Crutcher, the driver, did not respond to her commands and walked away with his hands up. Prosecutors have charged her with committing manslaughter ""in the heat of passion."" The shooting has sparked outrage and is part of a larger pattern of police killings of black individuals. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave and a separate investigation is being conducted to determine if Crutcher's civil rights were violated."

A recent article in the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta has sparked a national debate in Russia about the role of social media in promoting suicide among young people. The article claims that Russia's most popular social network, VKontakte (VK), has numerous groups that encourage vulnerable young people to kill themselves. The article alleges that at least 80 recent suicides can be linked to these online groups. Critics have accused the article of sensationalism and placing too much emphasis on the internet as a cause of juvenile suicide. However, the article has also prompted law enforcement agencies to launch a criminal case over groups on VK that allegedly promote suicide. Russia has one of the highest rates of youth suicide in the world, and the article has brought much-needed attention to this serious issue.

A six-week-old girl died after falling down an elevator shaft in a Brooklyn apartment building. The mother attempted to push the stroller into the out-of-service elevator on the 23rd floor, but it wasn't there. Both the mother and the baby fell onto the roof of the elevator and then dropped further to the 17th floor. The baby was found unconscious and unresponsive and was pronounced dead at the hospital. The cause of death is still unknown, and an investigation is ongoing. The apartment complex has a history of elevator violations, with over 120 violations since 2005. The elevator involved in the incident had been inspected recently, and one non-hazardous violation was issued. The building's elevator service company declined to comment, and the Elevator Industries Association did not respond to inquiries. The incident is now under investigation, and all elevators in the complex will be tested for safety.

"The author criticizes the Republican Party for not defending women against Donald Trump's sexist remarks and behavior. She questions why GOP leaders did not stand up for women after they had defended the party against accusations of sexism for years. The author suggests that the party prioritized appealing to certain voters over appealing to women. She argues that Trump's comments were not just ""locker room talk"" but a confession of assault. The author highlights how the Republican Party ignored Trump's chauvinism and even used their influence to force Republicans to support him. She believes that the GOP will suffer in the election and calls for the political obituaries of Trump's defenders. The author concludes by stating that she will not vote for Trump and warns that the GOP will lose the women's vote if they do not defend them."

Many Obama voters flipped to Trump, and he outperformed Romney among union households, whites without a college degree, and low-income households. The success of Obama's coalition may have been due to his unique talent as a politician, rather than a stable majority. The Democratic Party is now facing a struggle for dominance between Sanders supporters and the establishment wing. With no legislative victories in sight and upcoming electoral losses, the party's future is uncertain. Economic insecurity may have contributed to the rise of racism and far-right political parties. To prevent the views that led to Trump's victory, Democrats need to focus on delivering economic gains to working people.

Venezuela is currently facing political turmoil as President Nicolas Maduro's version of chavismo has brought chaos to the country and turned voters against him. The opposition has been pushing for a recall referendum to remove Maduro from power, but the government has been delaying and suspending the process. Venezuelans have taken to the streets in protest, but security forces and government sympathizers have responded violently. The military and paramilitary groups continue to support Maduro, but there are signs of cultural differences and potential divisions within the military. The opposition is calling for dialogue and negotiations, but many see it as a stalling tactic. The situation in Venezuela is uncertain and the future remains unclear.

Shawn Gill experienced a case of stolen and mistaken identity when someone used his name after a car accident. The actual driver was David Joseph Singer, who had a criminal record. Gill reported the identity theft and filed the necessary paperwork, but his license was still suspended and he lost his job as a driver for Lyft and Uber. Gill appealed the decision but faced difficulties in court due to incorrect police paperwork and testimony. Gill's friend sought help from a journalist to uncover the truth. It is unclear how Singer obtained Gill's ID information, and there are questions about why the incorrect information was not corrected. Gill's lawyer advised him not to talk to the police, but a letter from the officer who made the report could potentially clear Gill's record.

The researchers examined register-based data on individuals under 18 from different regions in Sweden and found that air pollution levels do impact psychiatric diagnoses in young people. The risk of having at least one psychiatric diagnosis increased with a 10 microgram per cubic meter increase in nitrogen dioxide levels in the air. Nitrogen dioxide is a harmful air pollutant that results from road traffic and fossil fuel use. Long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide has been associated with reduced lung function, respiratory problems, and increased allergy rates.

The suspect, who appeared to die from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, knew the victim's schedule and routine. The airport was closed and flights were canceled or diverted while police investigated. The airport has high security, but it is unclear if surveillance cameras captured the shooting. The victim, Michael Winchester, was a ramp supervisor for Southwest Airlines. He was described as a former student athlete at the University of Oklahoma, and his son currently plays for the Kansas City Chiefs.

One year after a dam ruptured in Brazil, causing a massive mudslide and environmental disaster, the people living along the affected river are still afraid to drink the water and eat the fish. The mudslide buried towns, killed 19 people, and caused extensive damage to the environment. The cleanup efforts by the mining company responsible have been slow and ineffective, and doubts remain about the safety of the river water. The government's priority now is to reforest the river banks to prevent further contamination. Many businesses, including fishing and steelmaking, rely on the river, and fishermen who lost their livelihoods receive compensation. However, many fishermen have lost hope of ever fishing in the river again.

Nigeria is investigating reports of sexual abuse and rape of women and girls who survived Boko Haram violence. Human Rights Watch published a report detailing accounts of sexual abuse and coercion by camp leaders, vigilante group members, policemen, and soldiers at camps in Borno State. The Inspector General of Police has set up a special team to investigate the cases. The victims, many of whom were impregnated by their abusers, had escaped captivity by Boko Haram only to become victims at the camps. The Borno State governor plans to deploy undercover detectives to the camps to bring the culprits to justice. Boko Haram is responsible for thousands of deaths and displacements in Nigeria.

"A man in Australia escaped with cuts to his leg after a shark collided with his surfboard near Byron Bay. The incident led to the closure of local beaches for 24 hours. The shark emerged from under the man while he was waiting for a wave, causing minor lacerations to his leg. The type of shark involved is unknown. This attack follows a similar incident in the same area a few weeks ago. The New South Wales coast has seen 14 unprovoked shark attacks in 2015, with a hotspot from Evans Head to Byron Bay. Efforts to control shark populations have been challenging, with a recent shark eco-barrier trial being canceled due to rough sea conditions. The government plans to increase tagging and relocation of sharks using ""smart drumlines"" to catch them. Shark attacks are on the rise due to the popularity of water sports and the movement of bait fish closer to shore, although fatalities are still rare."

But a question that continues to bother the patients is what caused Obesity in them.	The healthcare system in the United States is ill-prepared to treat obese patients, with doctors often unwilling to look past their weight and provide proper care. Obese patients face difficulties ranging from inadequate equipment to biased attitudes from healthcare providers. Doctors may spend less time with obese patients, fail to refer them for diagnostic tests, and attribute symptoms to their weight without investigating other causes. The lack of appropriate medical care for obese patients extends to treatments, with drug doses often not calibrated for obese patients and surgeons refusing to perform joint replacements unless the patient loses weight. The situation is further complicated by the fear of medical professionals of being penalized for complications and poor outcomes. The article also discusses the challenges faced by doctors and therapists in providing medical care to transgender patients due to limited knowledge and bias. The Mexican government's investigation into the disappearance of 43 college students in 2014 remains unsolved, leading many to question its ability and willingness to find answers.

The article highlights the stories of three survivors of the attacks in Iguala, Mexico, who continue to seek justice and fight for their rights.

A security crackdown in northern Rakhine state, Burma, following militant attacks has worsened the humanitarian situation and drawn international attention to Aung San Suu Kyi's government. The government has accused the Rohingya Muslim community of being behind the attacks, leading to a manhunt and reports of abuse by the military. The United Nations and the US have called for investigations into the alleged abuse and the restoration of humanitarian access. Human Rights Watch has reported burned villages and alleged rape of Muslim women by soldiers. The crisis is seen as a major test for Suu Kyi's new government, which is accused of not doing enough to address the Rohingya crisis. The Rohingya, who are essentially stateless, are considered illegal immigrants by many in the Buddhist-majority country. The security crackdown has displaced thousands of people and disrupted access to healthcare and food assistance. Suu Kyi has called for strengthening border security, following the rule of law, and creating a development plan for the area. However, the Rohingya community does not believe there is a militant group operating in the state and accuses the government of deliberate assassination. The crisis has further eroded confidence in Suu Kyi's government among the affected population.

People aren’t scared to post when behind a wall on social media.	A survey conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA) found that 52% of Americans consider the 2016 Presidential Election to be a significant source of stress. This stress is not limited to any particular political party and is exacerbated by social media posts, which can range from factual to inflammatory. Additionally, 38% of adults say that cultural and political discussions on social media cause them stress. The APA has provided a list of do's and don'ts for reading and reacting to election news. The stress trend is expected to continue until mid-November, as more people rely on online sources for news. While cable TV news remains the top source of election news, more millennials are turning to alternative sources for information.

Republicans in Congress are concerned about potential losses in the upcoming election. They are accepting the possibility of a Hillary Clinton victory and a Democratic majority in the Senate. This has led to discussions about how Republicans should proceed after the election. They must decide whether to cooperate with Democrats and try to get things done, or to adopt a noncooperative strategy in hopes of regaining control in the 2018 midterm elections. There are also questions about the future of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the Supreme Court nominee. Republicans fear that Clinton will be influenced by progressive forces and that compromises will be difficult to achieve. They also worry about the dissatisfaction among their voters and the potential backlash if they work with Democrats. However, some Republicans argue that waiting until 2018 may be a better strategy. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer believes there is a moral imperative to get government working again and hopes to work with Republicans. Hillary Clinton is seen as someone capable of building relationships with Republican leaders. Overall, if Democrats win the White House and Senate, considerable effort will be needed to bring a new spirit to a gridlocked Congress.

The text discusses the forgotten victims of the drought in the western United States, particularly in Nevada. The lack of rain and snow has caused reservoirs to reach record lows, rivers to dwindle, and lakes to disappear. The drought has had devastating effects on the Native American tribes in Nevada, such as the Yomba Reservation, where ranchers have been forced to sell off their herds. The drought not only has ecological and economic impacts but also sociological and psychological ones, leading to domestic violence, substance abuse, and a sense of displacement. The article also mentions the importance of preserving native cultures and the efforts being made to help tribal communities survive the drought.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred during a religious ceremony in the remote mountains of Balochistan. The region's remoteness made it challenging to provide emergency services, but rescue operations are underway. Pakistan's Prime Minister has condemned the blast and ordered authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice.

A new study suggesting that Earth could be doomed to warming of up to 13 degrees Fahrenheit is being dismissed as flawed by climate scientists. The study, published in Nature, offers a reconstruction of global sea-surface temperatures for the past two million years. However, several top scientists argue that the author's conclusions about catastrophic temperature rise are not supported by the data. They claim that the study's author made a fundamental mistake in her analysis. Other scientists also criticize the study for extrapolating from past ice ages to the present climate. NASA's chief climate scientist states that if greenhouse gas levels stay the same, temperatures may rise an additional 0.5 to 1 degree Celsius, not 7 degrees. The study's author defends her work, stating that it shows a close relationship between temperature and greenhouse gases. However, critics argue that her method is not the way to determine the Earth's sensitivity to CO2. The question of how sensitive Earth's climate will be to CO2 emissions remains open. In a separate article, a congressional committee reveals that sexual harassment and bullying among National Park Service employees at iconic parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone has been pervasive and ongoing for years.

This is not the first time Trump has faced criticism for his response to white supremacists, as he was hesitant to disavow support from former KKK leader David Duke during the campaign.

"PTSD is a misunderstood and stigmatized disorder that affects many veterans. It is estimated that 8 million Americans suffer from PTSD, with rates among Vietnam War and Iraq War veterans being particularly high. The negative connotations surrounding PTSD prevent many veterans from seeking help. Veterans want others to know that referring to them as ""weak"" is ignorant, as war experiences are incomprehensible to those who haven't lived through them. PTSD symptoms can be masked and go unnoticed, making it difficult to recognize. Many PTSD sufferers suffer in silence, fearing judgment and trying to appear strong. Contrary to popular belief, PTSD does not make individuals violent. Recovery from PTSD is possible, and veterans encourage others to seek help and know that they are not alone."

This is a sad article. Some many things are unknown for those born outside the country. It is always unfair that others are able to get deported after spending most of their lives in the USA, especially those that came at a very early age. Also US parents that adopt children should be granted us citizenship.	Adam Crapser, a South Korean man who was adopted by an American couple when he was 3 years old, is being deported back to South Korea. Crapser has spent 37 of his 41 years in the United States and has a family there. However, he is being held in an immigration detention center and will be deported as soon as the necessary arrangements are made. Crapser's life in the United States has been difficult, including being abandoned by his adoptive parents and experiencing abuse in subsequent foster homes. He has also had a criminal record, which makes him eligible for deportation. The deportation is a result of his adoptive parents and the adoption agency failing to register him for U.S. citizenship. Many intercountry adoptees face this issue, and Congress is currently considering a bill that would grant citizenship to all children adopted by U.S. citizens. Crapser hopes that the bill will pass, but it will be too late for him. The Adoptee Rights Campaign and others find his deportation appalling and are urging the community to call members of Congress to support a legislative fix.

The crisis in Flint is unacceptable and to hear about the drinking fountain in Chicago makes things even worse. It makes you think that major improvements need to made across the US. New laws need to be put in place to ensure everyone is getting healthy water.	Chicago has shut down hundreds of public drinking fountains due to excessive levels of lead in the water. The ongoing crisis in Flint, Michigan has prompted other communities to test for lead, including the Chicago Park District. Testing revealed that nearly a quarter of outdoor fountains and 14 indoor fountains and sinks exceeded the federal standard for lead levels. Some fountains had lead levels 80 times higher than the permissible level. All fountains and sinks with high lead levels have been disabled and will undergo further testing and repairs. The lack of adequate testing for lead in public settings is a national problem, according to public health officials. Lead can have serious health effects, especially in young children, and there is no safe level of lead in the body. Lead pipes and fixtures are still common in communities across the country. While taking a sip from a single fountain may not seriously affect health, it can contribute to cumulative lead exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations like the homeless and children.

North Korea has experienced heavy flooding caused by Typhoon Lionrock, leading to an unusual appeal for help from the government. The flooding has caused significant destruction to homes, infrastructure, and power systems in the country's Northeastern Hamgyong province. At least 133 people have been killed and nearly 400 are missing. The government has redirected its loyalty campaign to assist those affected. This public admission of needing help is rare for North Korea. The international community is being called upon to respond to the disaster. This comes after North Korea's fifth nuclear test, which was met with international condemnation.

Taking a plea deal was her best choice. There is never an acceptable reason for something like this to happen. The fact she had a young daughter too is scary.	A former teacher, Alexandria Vera, has agreed to a plea deal after being accused of having a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old student. She pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child, a lesser charge than the original continuous sexual abuse charge. The relationship lasted for nine months, and Vera claimed that she and the victim loved each other. She said the boy's family accepted their relationship and even became excited when she became pregnant with his child. However, when Child Protective Services questioned her, she had an abortion. Neighbors reported seeing the boy at Vera's house frequently, and she claimed he was her brother. Vera will be sentenced in January, with prosecutors agreeing to a maximum term of 30 years. The boy will remain in foster care, and his parents have been ordered to undergo therapy and attend parent classes.

"An animal-welfare organization called Four Paws recently rescued the remaining animals from a zoo near the Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis. The zoo, known as the ""world's worst zoo,"" had a history of neglect and animal deaths, including taxidermy of dead animals. The rescue mission was complicated due to the ongoing conflict in the region, but the team successfully evacuated the animals and transferred them to sanctuaries. The rescue has been hailed as a milestone in animal rights, but concerns remain about the wider issues of wildlife trafficking and the commercialization of wild animals in Gaza. The rescued animals will now receive care and rehabilitation in their new homes. There are hopes to create new legislation in Gaza to address these issues and prevent animal smuggling. The organization is also concerned about other zoos in conflict zones that require immediate attention."

The school failed to provide adequate medical care and made the boy attempt to walk to the bus despite his injuries. The contractor involved in the incident, Bryant Mosley, is no longer providing services to the school district. The school district claims that the use of restraint was necessary for the safety of the child and others in the room.

The text discusses how Donald Trump was able to give a voice to the pain and anger of millions of Americans who felt ignored and dismissed by the political elite. These individuals had been poorly educated and lacked the words to express their feelings and experiences. Trump appealed to their fears and frustrations, promising to restore their world and make America great again. The text also highlights the long-standing anger and despair that has been building for decades due to job loss and economic changes. The media and policymakers often use clinical terms to describe the struggles faced by these workers, while corporations prioritize profits over human decency. Trump's supporters accepted his controversial actions because they felt he understood their perspective.

New research suggests that habitat degradation poses a greater risk to the survival of turtles and tortoises than rising global temperatures. Over 60% of these species are listed as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered due to factors such as trading, collection for food and medicine, and habitat degradation. The study used climate models and the fossil record to investigate the impact of long-term climate change on these species. Results show that turtles and tortoises were able to withstand warmer climates in the past as long as there was enough water to support them. However, they are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, making climate change a significant threat to their conservation status.

They are accepting the possibility of a Hillary Clinton victory and a Democratic majority in the Senate. This has led to discussions about how Republicans should proceed after the election. They must decide whether to cooperate with Democrats and try to get things done, or to adopt a noncooperative strategy in hopes of regaining control in the 2018 midterm elections. There are also questions about the future of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the Supreme Court nominee. Republicans fear that Clinton will be influenced by progressive forces and that compromises will be difficult to achieve. They also worry about the dissatisfaction among their voters and the potential backlash if they work with Democrats. However, some Republicans argue that waiting until 2018 may be a better strategy. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer believes there is a moral imperative to get government working again and hopes to work with Republicans. Hillary Clinton is seen as someone capable of building relationships with Republican leaders. Overall, if Democrats win the White House and Senate, considerable effort will be needed to bring a new spirit to a gridlocked Congress.

The forest is at risk of being converted into an industrial tree plantation, and the company has already started work on building a drainage canal. The destruction of the forest and the orangutans' habitat is incompatible with Indonesia's national action plan for orangutans. The development violates Indonesia's legal processes and international commitments. Improved management is needed in Sungai Putri to address illegal logging and fires. There are conflicting opinions on the deforestation, with some supporting it for potential employment opportunities and compensation, while others argue that it is unsustainable. Alternative solutions that involve collaboration between various stakeholders are available to fulfill development objectives and alleviate poverty in Indonesia.

The US is setting up service centers families which is a great idea.	Iraqi military and police forces have discovered a mass grave near the town of Hamam al-Alil, south of Mosul, containing around 100 decapitated bodies. The bodies were found at an agricultural college and are currently being examined to determine their identities. The Iraqi Joint Command condemned the Islamic State for their crimes against the people. Meanwhile, Kurdish peshmerga forces recaptured the town of Bashiqa, with heavy fighting reported. The US officials stated that 33,000 Iraqi civilians have been displaced so far by the Mosul operation, lower than expected. Aid organizations estimate that up to 1.5 million civilians have been living in Mosul under Islamic State control, and at least 700,000 are expected to be displaced. The international community is preparing for a humanitarian emergency, with emergency relief supplies being brought to areas where displaced people are expected to go. The United States is assisting in preparations for governance in Mosul and vetting the displaced, but these tasks will be handled by the Iraqi and regional Kurdish governments.

It is currently on ""life support"" due to coral bleaching. The reef is home to numerous species and is considered the world's largest living thing. Preliminary findings show that 22% of its coral has died from the bleaching event. Climate change is the main cause of coral bleaching, as it leads to the expulsion of algae from the corals. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is conducting surveys to assess the impact of the bleaching. While scientists have expressed concerns about the reef's future, it is not beyond saving. The reef supports 70,000 jobs in reef tourism, and large sections of it are still in reasonable shape. The focus should be on better protecting the reef rather than giving up on it."

The motive is still under investigation, but witnesses mentioned a possible dispute between the victim and the suspect. The incident caused a temporary disruption in subway service. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority states that while many subway incidents are accidental, dozens of people are hit by trains each year. In a similar case in 2012, a woman was convicted and sentenced to 24 years in prison for pushing a man into the path of a subway train.

This article for example, showed that cholera outbreak in Haiti, Millions has been affected and people are dying but we don't have the resources to help them.	The text discusses the ongoing debate over the best approach to fighting cholera. On one side are public health advocates who believe that vaccines can make a significant impact in preventing and treating cholera. On the other side are public health officials who argue that vaccines are not effective enough and that the focus should be on improving water and sanitation infrastructure. The World Health Organization (WHO) has tried to support both approaches but has not settled on how to fund them. Cholera is a deadly disease caused by contaminated water, and it kills about 100,000 people worldwide each year. Two oral vaccines exist, but they have limitations and do not address the underlying causes of cholera. The debate over vaccines has caused division and hindered progress in the fight against cholera. The text also mentions the history of cholera and the breakthroughs in understanding and treating the disease. It highlights the devastating cholera outbreak in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and the missed opportunity to distribute vaccines. The text concludes by mentioning new ideas and approaches, such as using mobile phones to report cholera cases and promoting water sterilization tablets.

"Leonard Cohen, the renowned songwriter and poet, died in his sleep after a fall in his Los Angeles home. His death was sudden and unexpected. Cohen, known for his religious imagery and themes of redemption and desire, was buried in Montreal next to his parents. He was born into a Jewish family and moved to New York in 1966 to pursue a career in music. Although he influenced many musicians and received numerous honors, Cohen rarely achieved mainstream success. His most famous song, ""Hallelujah,"" has been covered by countless artists. Cohen's work explored religion, love, politics, and the search for balance in life."

Two American service members also died in ground clashes. Conflicting reports on the number of casualties and no official account of the airstrikes have been provided. Some local officials claim that up to 100 civilians were killed or wounded. The incident is reminiscent of the tragic events in Kunduz last year when a U.S. airstrike mistakenly targeted a hospital, killing 42 patients and staff members. NATO officials have not confirmed the reported deaths of the civilians. Angry relatives of the victims attempted to protest, but were stopped by security forces. U.S. military officials confirmed the deaths of the two American service members and stated their commitment to helping Afghan partners defend their nation.

These schools punished students for speaking their native languages or observing indigenous traditions, and subjected them to physical and sexual assault, medical experimentation, and sterilization.

It really is disgusting what these governments are doing.	Insha Mushtaq, a 14-year-old girl from Indian-administered Kashmir, lost her vision in both eyes after being hit by pellets. She has been in and out of hospitals for the past three months in an attempt to regain her vision, but nothing has worked so far. Insha remains hopeful and still dreams of becoming a doctor. The ongoing unrest in Kashmir has resulted in the deaths of 89 civilians and thousands of injuries. Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir, and the region has been a source of conflict for over 60 years. Pellet guns, originally used as a non-lethal weapon in 2010, have caused over a thousand eye injuries in recent months. Insha's family is struggling to cope with her injuries, and she tries to stay positive despite the challenges ahead.

The majority of these casualties were caused by airstrikes from a coalition led by Saudi Arabia. At least 329 civilians have been killed and 426 injured since the beginning of August. Saudi Arabia and its allies are trying to prevent an international investigation into possible war crimes. The United States and Britain, major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia, are finding it harder to ignore the bloodshed. The most recent example of the carnage was an airstrike on a market and residential area in Hodeidah, which killed at least 26 civilians. The United Nations has documented numerous attacks on civilian facilities by both coalition and rebel forces. Doctors Without Borders has pulled staff members out of six hospitals in Yemen after coalition planes bombed a facility. The United Nations has also expressed concern over the blockade of the city of Taiz, which has left residents critically short of food and water. The majority of civilian casualties have been caused by the Saudi-led coalition, according to a report to the Human Rights Council. Saudi Arabia and President Hadi's government have condemned the report as biased and have proposed a Yemeni commission to investigate human rights violations. Rights groups argue that a national body lacks expertise and that its reporting falls short of international standards. The European Union has drafted a competing resolution calling for a United Nations mission to Yemen. The Council will decide how to proceed after a week of diplomatic negotiations. President Hadi accused Iran of blocking the path towards peace in Yemen.

"The Trump campaign has been pursuing a strategy of publicly courting black voters while privately seeking to depress their turnout, according to a BusinessWeek article. The campaign has three major voter suppression operations targeting idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. These operations include placing negative ads on select African American radio stations and using Facebook ""dark posts"" to deliver targeted messages. The campaign believes that depressing Clinton's vote total among these groups will benefit Trump. However, there is evidence that negative campaigning does not significantly depress voter turnout. Trump's approach to African Americans has been seen as insincere, with many of his events aimed at them taking place in predominantly white areas. As a result, Trump's polling among African Americans is poor, with him trailing Clinton by a large margin. While Trump's advisors believe that he doesn't need black votes to win, future Republican candidates will, and the campaign's efforts to suppress black voter turnout may harm the party's relationship with this demographic for years to come."

However, deaths from motor vehicle traffic and homicide have decreased over the same time period. Younger children may attempt suicide impulsively due to bad relationships with family and friends, while older children may do so because of relationship issues. Warning signs for suicide in children include increased sadness, irritability, anger, loss of interest in friends or activities, and saying mean or derogatory things. It is important for parents to talk to their children and listen to their feelings. There is limited research on suicide in children, and experts hope that the report will raise awareness and lead to more prevention efforts.

Trump's proposed policies, such as building a border wall, deporting undocumented workers, and cutting taxes, could lead to financial panic and a possible recession. The repeal of Obamacare and the proposed tax cuts would disproportionately affect the poor, with millions potentially losing access to healthcare and the highest-income taxpayers benefiting the most. In order to balance the budget, the GOP would need to make significant spending cuts, which would likely impact assistance programs for the young and poor. Trump's vague plans make it unclear which specific policies would be eliminated, but House Speaker Paul Ryan's ""A Better Way"" plan provides some insight into potential cuts. Overall, Trump's presidency could make it much harder to be poor in America and represents a repudiation of Obama's economic policies."

The actual driver was David Joseph Singer, who had a criminal record. Gill reported the identity theft and filed the necessary paperwork, but his license was still suspended and he lost his job as a driver for Lyft and Uber. Gill appealed the decision but faced difficulties in court due to incorrect police paperwork and testimony. Gill's friend sought help from a journalist to uncover the truth. It is unclear how Singer obtained Gill's ID information, and there are questions about why the incorrect information was not corrected. Gill's lawyer advised him not to talk to the police, but a letter from the officer who made the report could potentially clear Gill's record.

A man dressed as a construction worker vandalized Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, using a sledgehammer and pickax to smash the symbol. The man attempted to remove the star but was unsuccessful. He claimed that he wanted to auction the star to raise money for women who have accused Trump of sexual assault or harassment. The suspect was later arrested on a charge of felony vandalism. The star will be replaced, and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce intends to prosecute the vandal to the full extent of the law. Trump's star has been targeted multiple times in the past, with incidents of paint, graffiti, and other defacement.

The UN reports that tens of thousands of civilians have been abducted by ISIS in Mosul and used as human shields. The group has also killed former security service members and civilians who refused to obey their orders. Iraqi, Kurdish, and allied forces are advancing to retake Mosul, but there are concerns that ISIS will use the remaining 1.5 million people in the city to defend themselves. Reports suggest that civilians have been forced from their homes and relocated inside the city since the offensive began. ISIS is preventing families from fleeing to territory held by the Iraqi army and targeting those suspected of disloyalty.

Nothing bad will happen but we need not exploit things just cause we can.	Coconut trees are facing threats from lethal yellowing bacteria in the Caribbean, Cote d'Ivoire, and Papua New Guinea, which could lead to a shortage of coconuts. Unlike other crops, coconuts cannot be stored in seed vaults due to their high water content, so maintaining living gene banks is necessary. However, these gene banks require a lot of space and are vulnerable to land grabs. Additionally, growing and breeding coconuts is challenging due to their long maturation period and the need for hand pollination. Efforts to isolate and freeze coconut embryos for preservation are still unreliable. Funding for coconut gene banks is also limited, as most coconut growers are small farmers. The future of the Coconut Genetic Resources Network (COGENT) is uncertain due to funding issues.

The number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen has risen to 1,410 within three weeks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The outbreak was declared on October 6, and by October 10, there were 24 suspected cases. However, as of Thursday, there were 1,410 suspected cases in 10 out of Yemen's 23 governorates. The conflict between a Saudi Arabia-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi group has destroyed much of Yemen's infrastructure, making it difficult to control the disease outbreak. Cholera is just one of the risks in Yemen's war, which has left millions displaced and in need of medical help. Only 47 of the suspected cases have tested positive for cholera, and the outbreak has spread beyond the capital to nine other governorates. Children under 10 account for half of the cases, with six deaths from cholera and 36 associated deaths from acute watery diarrhea. Prompt treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics is crucial in severe cases.

Inmates have no say in who they share a cell with, even if the cellmate has a violent history or severe mental illness. If they refuse a cellmate, they are placed in restraints for hours or days. Restraints are also used as punishment for inmates who break rules or get into fights. The conditions in the Special Management Unit (SMU) at Lewisburg are harsh, with inmates spending nearly 24 hours a day in small cells with little room to move. In 2014 and 2015, there were 228 in-cell fights and assaults at Lewisburg, resulting in injuries and even deaths. The use of restraints at Lewisburg has been criticized by inmates, lawyers, and auditors, but the Bureau of Prisons denies any mistreatment. Changes have been made to the SMU, but the use of restraints remains unchanged. Inmates are left with few options: accept a violent cellmate or be restrained.

A report commissioned by Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand warns that climate change poses a significant threat to the world's coffee supply. The report highlights the impact of warming temperatures on farmland, which will reduce the global area suitable for coffee by about 50%. It also emphasizes the increased risk of diseases and pests, such as coffee rust and the coffee berry borer. Major coffee companies have been aware of these threats for years and have been implementing support programs for coffee growers. However, the report suggests that no single company is large enough to tackle the challenge of climate change on its own. The World Coffee Research group is developing adaptive strategies to address the issue, including preserving genetic diversity, creating a variety catalog, and evaluating new coffee varieties. Despite these efforts, there are still major gaps in knowledge on how to best help coffee producers adapt to climate change. The report raises concerns about the livelihoods of the 125 million people worldwide who depend on coffee, particularly those in developing countries. Urgent action is needed to prevent devastating consequences for these communities.

The blame game between the county and national governments has been criticized, with the focus being on rescue operations. Efforts are being made to save those still trapped, with additional tools and machinery ordered. The NCA is assessing adjacent buildings for safety, as they pose a danger to the rescue operations. All buildings in Kisii Town will be assessed to ensure their safety, and contractors are warned against violating construction procedures.

Many of them are facing difficult circumstances, including food and medicine shortages, as well as neglect from their families. The siege imposed by pro-government forces has made it nearly impossible to find medicine to treat chronic diseases commonly experienced by older people. Overstretched medical facilities are unable to provide proper care, leading to more deaths. Some families have even abandoned their older family members due to the extreme conditions. The situation has left many older residents feeling weak, frightened, and helpless. Despite the dangers, some refuse to leave their homes, while others are trapped and unable to leave due to the siege. The older residents of Aleppo are struggling to balance their own needs with the demands of their families, often sacrificing their own well-being. The war has taken away their dignity and left them feeling isolated and afraid.

For nearly a century, the Canadian government forcibly assimilated indigenous Canadians by taking them from their families and placing them in church-run boarding schools. These schools punished students for speaking their native languages or observing indigenous traditions, and subjected them to physical and sexual assault, medical experimentation, and sterilization. Photographer Daniella Zalcman's book, Signs of Your Identity, documents the lasting effects of this trauma through double exposure portraits of former students and related places or items.

Seven leaders of an armed militia who led a 41-day stand-off at a US federal wildlife refuge in Oregon have been acquitted of conspiracy and firearms charges. The occupation of the refuge, which began in January, was a protest against federal control of land. The defendants argued that they did not intend to prevent federal officers from going to work, and the jury was unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that they had. The acquittal has been seen as a victory for states' rights and a blow to the federal government. The case against a second group of defendants is due to go to trial in February.

The text discusses the ongoing conflict between humans and elephants in Zambia's national parks and buffer zones. Farmers like Humphrey Mubita and Kelvin Kapesa face the loss of crops and even lives due to elephants encroaching on their land. They criticize the lack of compensation from the government and call for the installation of electric fences. Namukulo Munalula Hayumbu suggests an insurance scheme to compensate for losses. Conservation organizations like Conservation Lower Zambezi (CLZ) support park rangers in their fight against poaching but face challenges in gaining community support. The text emphasizes the need for long-term solutions, such as education and curbing global demand for ivory.

They state that humans are causing climate change, with evidence of rising seas, warming oceans and atmosphere, melting ice, changing rainfall patterns, and increasing acidity in the ocean. The scientists criticize politicians and real estate developers without scientific experience who deny climate change. They express sadness that the Republican Party, historically supportive of environmental initiatives, is now rejecting climate science. The scientists emphasize the economic and social costs of inaction and call for rational decision-making to manage climate change risks. They also criticize the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, for wanting to scrap environmental agreements. The scientists highlight the success of renewable energy sources in reducing emissions and argue that action to reduce pollution does not harm the economy. They warn that voting for anti-science politicians will contribute to the climate change problem and urge voters to consider the conversation they will have with their children about their choices.

"The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, was known to the FBI for years but was not considered a security threat. This highlights the challenge of identifying ""lone wolf"" terrorists who are not connected to established extremist groups. The FBI retains data on individuals even after determining they are not a threat, raising concerns about privacy rights. The shooting has sparked debate about whether individuals interviewed by the FBI should be able to purchase guns or be under continued surveillance. The FBI interviewed Mateen multiple times but was unable to find any suspicious ties. The bureau is allowed to keep data on individuals even after closing investigations, which has raised concerns about privacy. Trust between local communities and the government is crucial in identifying domestic lone-wolf extremists before they commit acts of terrorism. The difficulty in identifying individuals like Mateen highlights the lack of a profile for potential terrorists."

The death toll in the Mediterranean Sea has reached a new record number, with over 4,600 people dead or missing this year. The central Mediterranean route, mainly departing from Libya, has seen the highest number of deaths. The issue is not the lack of resources in rescue operations, but the instability and violence in Libya, where human traffickers exploit people's hopes for a better life. The Libyan Civil War worsened the situation, leaving vulnerable migrants in a dangerous position. Traffickers are increasingly unconcerned with safety, forcing migrants to make the journey in rough seas without proper equipment. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) advocates for long-term policies that provide information about the dangers of the journey and safe passages for migrants. The IOM is also fighting against a negative narrative on migration, highlighting its historical positive impact.

At least 239 migrants are believed to have drowned in two shipwrecks off the coast of Libya this week, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Survivor accounts suggest that two overcrowded boats broke up just off the Libyan coast on Wednesday. The 31 survivors were taken to the Italian island of Lampedusa. If true, these shipwrecks bring the toll of dead and missing in the Mediterranean to 4,220 this year, the highest on record. Most of the migrants appear to have come from sub-Saharan Africa. The European Union is conducting a search-and-rescue operation in the western Mediterranean, but the focus remains on deterrence rather than protection. The shifting migration patterns have been a boon to smugglers, as demand has increased across the trickier North African route.

The study involved analyzing surveys from over 2,200 well-educated moms across the country, and mothers of only middle-school-age children reported the highest levels of stress, loneliness, and emptiness. Middle school is a challenging time for children, with raging hormones, changing bodies and brains, exposure to peer pressure and risky behaviors, and a desire for independence while still feeling dependent on parents. Parents often struggle to navigate these changes and may not realize that their children still want a relationship with them. It is important for parents to listen, be supportive, and not give up during this time. Developing a strong relationship during middle school can carry into the teen years and young adulthood. Mothers should also reach out to other moms for support during this challenging time.

The Pilcomayo River in Paraguay is experiencing an extensive die-off of caiman, fish, and other river creatures due to a combination of drought and mismanagement. Up to 98% of caimans and 80% of capybaras are suspected dead. The river has dried up for nearly 435 miles and the government has declared an environmental emergency. The mismanagement of water resources and infrastructure by both Paraguay and Argentina has exacerbated the crisis. The river's wandering behavior and the significant amount of sediment it transports downstream have contributed to the blockage and dispersal of the river outside its channel. The government is working to find a solution, but there is no water to release or divert. Zimbabwe plans to sell its wildlife, including elephants and possibly endangered African wild dogs, to replenish its coffers due to cash shortages and a drought. Critics argue that the mismanagement of the economy and lack of accountability make this plan unworkable. South Australia has been hit by a destructive storm just 24 hours after a super cell thunderstorm knocked out the state's entire power network.

The mudslide buried towns, killed 19 people, and caused extensive damage to the environment. The cleanup efforts by the mining company responsible have been slow and ineffective, and doubts remain about the safety of the river water. The government's priority now is to reforest the river banks to prevent further contamination. Many businesses, including fishing and steelmaking, rely on the river, and fishermen who lost their livelihoods receive compensation. However, many fishermen have lost hope of ever fishing in the river again.

Research from 1999 to 2010 show retail sales of prescription opioids quadrupled.""Even in children younger than 6 years,"	A recent study has found that rates of toddlers and preschoolers being hospitalized for opioid overdoses have more than doubled in recent years. The study analyzed data from over 13,000 records of children admitted to U.S. hospitals between 1997 and 2012. The increase in overdoses is possibly due to the rise in prescribed painkillers, such as OxyContin and Vicodin. Young children are often exposed to these drugs by finding pills on the floor, getting into their parents' purses, or opening bottles. The study emphasizes the need for parents to limit children's exposure to these medications and for companies to improve packaging. The study also highlights the underreported issue of young overdoses in the pediatrics community. Additionally, the study found that heroin poisonings among children increased by 161%.

A palm oil company named PT Mohairson Pawan Khatulistiwa plans to clear more than half of the Sungai Putri forest in Indonesia, which is home to a critically endangered orangutan population. Despite the Indonesian government's commitment to protecting peat, forests, and orangutans, the company has been granted a license to destroy the forest. The forest is at risk of being converted into an industrial tree plantation, and the company has already started work on building a drainage canal. The destruction of the forest and the orangutans' habitat is incompatible with Indonesia's national action plan for orangutans. The development violates Indonesia's legal processes and international commitments. Improved management is needed in Sungai Putri to address illegal logging and fires. There are conflicting opinions on the deforestation, with some supporting it for potential employment opportunities and compensation, while others argue that it is unsustainable. Alternative solutions that involve collaboration between various stakeholders are available to fulfill development objectives and alleviate poverty in Indonesia.

"Azealia Banks tearfully shared her side of the Russell Crowe incident in a new interview. She described the argument that led to her being kicked out of Crowe's hotel room as ""humiliating."" Banks claimed that Crowe made disparaging comments about her career, and when she responded, the whole table turned against her. She alleged that Crowe called her the N-word, choked her, and physically removed her from the suite. However, a source close to Crowe denied these claims and stated that he acted in defense of his guests. Banks also expressed disappointment that RZA, who invited her to the party, did not stand up for her. RZA later contradicted Banks' narrative and accused her of threatening someone with a glass. Despite the backlash, Banks remains resilient and confident in her youth and music career."

A gas shortage in the Southeastern United States has caused long lines at gas stations and limited availability of fuel. The shortage was caused by a leak in a pipeline that runs from Houston to New Jersey, resulting in over 300,000 gallons of gas being leaked. The states affected by the shortage include Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas. While prices have increased, they are still below $2.50 per gallon in many areas. The shortage has led to panic and frustration among drivers, with some gas stations completely running out of fuel. Efforts are being made to address the shortage, including repairs to the pipeline and alternative methods of transporting gasoline.

The bodies of former Polish President Lech Kaczynski and his wife are being exhumed as part of a new investigation into the 2010 plane crash that killed 96 prominent Poles. The ruling party, Law and Justice, led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the late president's twin brother, has cast doubt on previous investigations and believes the crash was an assassination. They are seeking evidence against former Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who they believe had some involvement. The exhumations will involve tests to determine the cause of the crash, including checking for explosives. The exhumations are controversial, with some dismissing conspiracy theories and others upset at the violation of cultural taboos. The crash occurred while the delegation was traveling to honor Polish officers murdered by the Soviet secret police during World War II.

Giving them access to proper medical training to spread better health practices and health education to the population could be the most effective thing to preventing more spread of the virus	Scientists are puzzled by the uneven pattern of damage caused by the Zika virus across Latin America. While the virus has infected over 650,000 people in the region, the majority of babies born with congenital neurological damage linked to Zika have been clustered in northeastern Brazil. Health officials and scientists are investigating other factors that may be contributing to the higher toll in this region, such as the presence of other mosquito-borne viruses or environmental and genetic factors. The number of cases of birth defects linked to Zika outside of Brazil has been relatively low, leading researchers to caution that it will take years to fully understand the dangers the virus poses to babies' brains. The outbreak in Puerto Rico is being closely monitored, but the mainland United States has so far averted a major outbreak. The lack of funding for Zika research and prevention has hindered efforts to accurately count the number of people infected and assess the true impact of the virus.

Details of that Wells Fargo new accounts scam, how the lowly bank tellers would make up accounts because they were paid so low and badgered so much that they felt obligated to cheat like this. For shame. I'm surprised these details didn't get really publicized when this thing was happening.	Wells Fargo Bank has admitted to firing 5,300 low-paid workers over five years for opening fake accounts to meet sales targets. The bank has faced outrage and has stalled stock awards to two top executives. Wells Fargo CEO/Chairman John Stumpf admitted to finding nearly 80,000 phony accounts in Pennsylvania. The bank claims that it did not impose fees for most of these accounts. However, former employees have reported unethical practices, such as raiding customers' private data and forging credit card application signatures. Other banks, both community banks and big multinationals, have also engaged in similar practices. Wells Fargo has stated that it has scrapped its incentive system and will come up with a new plan next year.

India, one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters, will ratify the Paris climate agreement next month, according to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The agreement, which aims to limit global temperature increase to below 2C, will only come into force after being ratified by at least 55 countries responsible for 55% of global carbon emissions. The US and China, together responsible for 40% of emissions, have already joined the agreement. Once ratified, countries must wait at least three years before exiting the agreement.

It must have been frightening for her to be tied up, but if I were that rich, I certainly would not flaunt it.	Kim Kardashian West was held at gunpoint in a robbery in Paris, where a group of men stole millions of dollars' worth of jewelry. The concierge, Abdulrahman, revealed that the robbers initially wanted money, not jewels. There was speculation that a diamond ring Kardashian West showed off on social media prompted the heist, but Abdulrahman clarified that the robber was only interested in money. After giving him the ring, the thief pocketed it and continued to demand money. Some jewels and gold were lost because the thief left the bag open. The police are still investigating, but no arrests have been made. Kardashian West has reduced her social media presence and public outings since the incident.

This incident brings attention to the attacks on priests in Mexico, with two others being found shot to death after being kidnapped. While robbery is suggested as the motive for the killings, fellow priests believe there may be other factors involved. The priest had been threatened recently due to his activism and criticism of corruption and crime in the area. This incident sparked unrest in the town of Catemaco, where residents demanded the priest's release. Mexico has seen the killing of 31 priests since 2006, with Veracruz, Guerrero, and Mexico states being the most dangerous for priests due to drug cartel violence.

More than 100 LGBTI people attempted to participate in the celebrations, but were escorted back to Kampala by police. The minister for ethics and integrity had threatened to mobilize mobs against participants. Homosexuality is illegal in Uganda. This is the second time the LGBTI community has tried to hold gay pride celebrations this year, with the previous attempt resulting in arrests. The reason for the targeting of this event is unclear, as previous celebrations have gone unnoticed by the police. In 2014, a bill to further criminalize homosexuality was overturned in court.

I think you'd find this interesting to read.	The text highlights the ongoing disaster in Haiti caused by Hurricane Matthew, which has received little media coverage compared to previous disasters. The hurricane has caused significant material damage, including the destruction of houses, crops, and trees, as well as a spike in cholera cases. The lack of urgency and support from the central government and international agencies has frustrated local officials and community organizations. The slow response has led to desperation among the affected population, with some resorting to looting. The centralization of resources in Port-au-Prince and limited aid funds have contributed to the dire situation. The priority now is to support farmers in the affected regions to recover and rebuild their livelihoods. The Lambi Fund of Haiti is working with partner organizations to clean canals, clear fields, and provide local seeds for planting. The text emphasizes the need for awareness and support from the international community to help Haiti achieve food sovereignty and recover from the disaster.

Being interested in sports and health together, this is a solid article showing the impact eye injuries have on different types of sports. It's somewhat common to see these injuries present themselves in basketball, baseball, and sports without protective gear. That's just the nature of sports where consequences happen.	Eye injuries in youth sports are common and often involve activities that are not typically considered risky for eyes, according to a study of emergency room visits related to eye problems among athletes. The study found that about 30,000 sports-related eye injuries were treated each year at participating emergency rooms, with a majority occurring in people younger than 18. Basketball was the sport most likely to result in eye injuries, followed by baseball, softball, air guns, cycling, and soccer. While most injuries were minor, some required surgery and threatened athletes' vision. The study suggests that protective eyewear, such as wraparound glasses, could help prevent these injuries.

This article talks about different issues President Trump has had his hands in on and how some problems are arising. I think the countries need to stand alone and work on their own issues so they have home build strength. Seems like a lot of compromising is not taking place.	Mexico is bracing for the consequences of a Trump presidency, as his campaign promises of building a wall, renegotiating trade deals, and deporting Mexican immigrants threaten the country's economy and relationship with the US. The peso has already suffered a significant drop, and experts predict a turbulent financial future for Mexico. The election has also caused an existential crisis for Mexico, as it reflects the negative image the country has in the US. Canada is also concerned about the impact of Trump's presidency, particularly on trade. While some Canadians reacted with anxiety, others saw it as an opportunity for pride. The election has forced Mexico to rethink its relationship with the US, and President Peña Nieto has expressed his willingness to work with Trump. However, paying for a wall is out of Mexico's vision, and the country hopes to continue collaborating with the US for mutual development. The election will likely have the most profound impact on the economy, as the US and Mexico are deeply integrated in terms of trade and employment. Mexico is America's third-largest trading partner, and millions of American jobs are tied to trade with Mexico. Trump's argument that Mexico benefits more from NAFTA than the US resonated with some voters, but experts believe that Mexico has little leverage to apply pressure in the relationship. An economic crisis in Mexico could lead to a migration crisis, as Mexicans may seek work in the US. However, some believe that the threat from the outside will bring Mexicans together and encourage them to work harder. There is optimism that Trump's hostile talk will diminish once he takes office, and that economic factors will temper his policies towards Mexico. However, with the Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump's victory signals an ideological realignment in the US.

It would be good to see organizations working within the region to bring residents quality water.	"The residents of Matheny Tract, a poor community in California's Central Valley, have been living with contaminated water for years. They have had to pay for bottled water in addition to their tainted tap water. However, legislation based on the ""human right to water"" is now being implemented, and Matheny Tract will be the first community to receive clean water under this law. Similar legislation has been introduced in Michigan, but is still stuck in committee. The issue of water inequality in rural communities has been brought to the forefront by the state's record-breaking drought. Many small rural systems in California have contaminated water, affecting an estimated 160,000 people. These communities often lack public investment and are overlooked by their local governments. The right to water is seen as a fundamental human right, and California's legislation is seen as a step towards addressing water inequality. The state has also introduced a publicly accessible database on water systems that are out of compliance. Matheny Tract is scheduled to receive clean water on June 1, marking a significant improvement for the community."

During a highway roadblock, an armed encounter occurred between Dimaukom's men and the police, resulting in the deaths of 10 men.

The squirrels were found to have two different species of leprosy bacterium, one of which is almost identical to a strain recovered from a medieval human skeleton. There is currently no evidence of squirrel-to-human transmission, but researchers are concerned about the health of the endangered red squirrels. The reason why squirrels, humans, and armadillos are the only known species to harbor the bacterium is still unknown. The discovery of leprosy in squirrels may help researchers understand how the disease manifests in humans and how it spreads.

The world's wildlife trade policy body, CITES, is calling for better treatment and tracking of illegally traded animals that are confiscated by authorities. Between 2010 and 2014, over 60,000 wild creatures were seized, with a fifth of them being threatened species. However, wildlife advocates argue that animals often suffer after being confiscated, as they are sometimes sent to inadequate facilities, returned to traffickers, or released back into the wild where they can spread diseases. CITES guidelines state that confiscated animals should be sent back to the exporting country, a designated rescue center, or other appropriate places, with humane treatment ensured. However, this doesn't always happen due to cost, impracticality, or lack of designated rescue centers. CITES member countries have agreed to distribute a questionnaire to gather information on how nations deal with confiscated animals, and Humane Society International has offered recommendations on setting up rescue centers.

Members of the band Eagles of Death Metal, who were playing at the Bataclan concert hall during the Paris Attacks, attended a memorial in Paris to honor the 130 people killed in the coordinated terrorist attacks. The band's frontman, Jesse Hughes, praised the city's response to the tragedy. Sting performed the first show at the Bataclan since the attacks, but Hughes was not allowed to enter due to his previous comments about Muslim security personnel collaborating with the attackers. Hughes later apologized for his statement. At the memorial, Hughes expressed his gratitude to the people of France. Sting's performance included a moment of silence and a statement in French to remember the victims and celebrate the venue's history.

The inhumane way some of our food, particularly chicken, makes it's way to our dinner plate is beyond disturbing. Factory farming is simply another word for animal torture.	Scientists have found that the method used by the U.S. poultry industry to stun chickens before slaughter does not consistently render them unconscious. This means that a significant number of chickens likely experience intense suffering when they are killed. The lack of regulations governing the humane slaughter of chickens in the U.S. has allowed poultry companies to prioritize meat quality over ensuring that chickens are reliably stunned. Animal protection groups are pressuring companies to phase out the use of electric water-baths and adopt alternative methods, such as controlled atmosphere killing. Gas stunning systems are considered more humane and produce better meat quality. The current process of slaughtering chickens also causes them stress and pain, with many experiencing broken bones and wing damage. The U.S. Agriculture Department estimates that hundreds of thousands of birds are unintentionally boiled alive each year. Animal welfare groups are campaigning to improve conditions for broiler chickens and some companies, like Perdue Farms, have pledged to install gas stunning systems in their facilities.

This has reached the point where it is harmful to children everyday even in school. Idk when this issue will be resolved but soemoen has to interevene.	Over 1,800 public primary schools in Delhi will close to protect children from dangerous levels of air pollution. The decision affects more than a million children. The smog is a result of burning crops, fireworks, dust, and vehicle emissions. The most dangerous particles, PM 2.5, reached 600 micrograms per cubic meter. Sustained exposure to this concentration is equivalent to smoking 40 cigarettes a day and increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, asthma, and pneumonia. The pollution has caused visible effects on children, including coughing and difficulty breathing. Foreigners and elites have expressed concern about winter air pollution, and some embassies discourage families with children from moving to Delhi. Parents have reported symptoms such as burning eyes and congestion in their children. The city has taken these measures for the first time, and they hope weather conditions will improve soon. Keeping children at home reduces their exposure to air pollution, but indoor air quality is often not much better unless doors and windows are closed and sealed.

"In his first televised sit-down interview since becoming President-elect, Donald Trump told his supporters to stop harassing minorities. He expressed sadness over reports of harassment and urged his supporters to ""stop it."" Trump also criticized the protests that have broken out since his election, calling them ""horrible"" and blaming the press for exaggerating the incidents. He discussed his plans for FBI Director James Comey, saying he hasn't made up his mind about whether to ask for his resignation. Trump also addressed his stance on same-sex marriage, abortion, and deporting undocumented immigrants. He pledged to focus on deporting criminals and building a border wall. Trump defended his transition team, which includes lobbyists, saying that they know the system but will be phased out. He stuck by his claim that he knows more than American generals about fighting ISIS. Trump also expressed support for ditching the Electoral College and handing the presidency to the winner of the popular vote. He dismissed concerns about the impact of his presidency on his family's businesses, saying that saving the country is more important. Trump plans to turn down the presidential salary and does not intend to change his tone."

According to an FBI report, hate crimes against Muslims in the US have increased by 67% in one year, reaching the highest number since 2001. The report also reveals a rise in hate crimes against Jewish, black, and LGBTQ individuals. These figures have been linked to President-elect Donald Trump's anti-minority rhetoric, which has fueled public anger and aggression. Experts believe that the actual number of hate crimes is likely higher than reported, and they expect the situation to worsen due to the mainstreaming of Islamophobia by Trump.

"Maia Sandu, a presidential candidate in Moldova, is facing criticism for being a single woman. Former President Vladimir Voronin, who is chairman of the communist party, stated that presidential candidates should be married and campaign with their spouses. He refused to even shake Sandu's hand, calling her a ""betrayal of family values"" and a ""national disgrace."" Bishop Marchel, a leader in the Moldovan Orthodox Church, also attacked Sandu, claiming that her attitude towards Christian morality diverges from normal principles. Sandu defended herself, stating that being a single woman is not a shame. Voronin also criticized Sandu's opponent, Igor Dodon, but implied that Dodon is a preferable choice. Sandu has campaigned on a pro-European Union platform, while Dodon aligns his views with those of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

"Multiple studies show that Trump's sexist rhetoric can have a significant impact on thinking, stress, and self-esteem. Women have expressed feeling gross and objectified by his comments, and even trauma victims have been distressed by his behavior. Trump's defense that his words are ""just words"" or ""locker room talk"" does not render them harmless, as rude language can impair cognition and lead to less creative thinking. Uncivil political discourse, especially in a presidential debate, undermines trust in government and discourages women from running for office. Discriminatory speech has negative consequences for women, leading to anger, depression, and lower self-esteem. Different types of discrimination can compound each other, with women of color experiencing even greater harm. Trump's candidacy exposes the bleak state of gender relations in the US and raises questions about how sexism will be taken seriously in the future."

Male models are being paid up to 75% less than women, according to a top modelling agent. Elizabeth Rose, who manages male models at Premier, believes it is unfair and not a form of female empowerment. She explains that women can be paid up to £40,000 for a top show, while male models only receive £10,000 on average. However, she notes that the situation is slowly changing as advertisers are increasingly using male models for grooming products. Elizabeth also highlights that the top 10 female models all make millions, whereas only the top three male models earn over a million. She tries to negotiate higher fees for male models but acknowledges that women face more discrimination due to their age. Elizabeth believes that change can happen if more agents and models refuse to accept unequal pay.

Three anti-poaching rangers, including two South Africans and a Mozambican, were attacked by angry villagers in Mozambique after apprehending a poacher. The rangers, including Sean van Niekerk, were whipped, stabbed, and pelted with rocks. Van Niekerk suffered a minor skull fracture, stab wounds, and injuries to his face and back. Despite the incident, he remains committed to saving wildlife. The attack occurred when the rangers were transporting the poacher to the police station and a mob from the community approached them. The police officers who were present fled, leaving the rangers to defend themselves until a helicopter arrived. Van Niekerk hopes that sharing this story will expose the incompetence and corruption of the police officers involved.

Ryan Collins, a man from Pennsylvania, has been sentenced to 18 months in jail for hacking into the accounts of celebrities and stealing nude photos and videos. He pleaded guilty to the charges and had stolen the usernames and passwords of over 600 people, including Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Scarlett Johansson, and Kirsten Dunst. Collins tricked his victims by sending emails that appeared to be from Google or Apple. Although he accessed the photos between 2012 and 2014, he was not charged with releasing them. Prosecutors have found no evidence linking Collins to the leaks or sharing the obtained information. He accessed at least 50 iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts using fraudulent email addresses.

The flood-ravaged state of Louisiana may face a population loss as residents consider leaving after the flood waters recede. While few people have confirmed their departure, it is a topic of discussion among many. The state's economy will suffer if there is a decline in population, as it will reduce spending and tax revenue. Louisiana experienced a 6% population decrease after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, taking over five years to recover. Although this year's exodus is unlikely to be as severe, the shortage of available housing and the closure of small businesses due to the flooding pose challenges. Additionally, the decline in oil industry jobs and the state's high unemployment rate further complicate the situation. The aid and insurance money that typically accompanies natural disasters may not be enough to prevent people from leaving, exacerbating an already struggling economy.

Urgent conservation measures were approved to protect the vaquita, including a permanent ban on gill net fishing and efforts to crack down on the totoaba trade. However, experts argue that these measures are not enough to save the species. The current plan neglects local livelihoods, fails to involve local fishermen in designing a sustainable management plan, and does not adequately address the totoaba trade. The ban on gill nets is seen as a step forward, but more interventions are needed to ensure the vaquita's recovery. This case highlights the challenges and complexities of endangered species conservation. Conservation efforts often come too late or lack the thoroughness needed to make a lasting impact. A long-term vision and proactive action are necessary to effectively conserve species and natural resources.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a viral infection that poses a greater threat to infants in the United States than Zika, but it is rarely discussed. CMV can cause permanent disabilities such as hearing loss, microcephaly, intellectual deficits, and vision abnormalities in up to 20% of infected infants. There is no vaccine or standard treatment for CMV, but there are hints that antiviral drugs may benefit some newborns. CMV is transmitted through contact with saliva and urine, often from diaper-wearing children to adults. Pregnant women often get it from toddlers, especially those in day care. However, few women are warned about this infection, and less than half of obstetrician-gynecologists provide information on how to avoid CMV. Some experts argue that education campaigns and infant screening for the infection should be carried out to prevent the devastating effects of CMV. Routine screening of newborns for CMV is being pushed to identify those who are infected early and provide them with necessary tests and treatment. A recent study found that infants with CMV symptoms at birth who took an antiviral drug for six months had better hearing and cognitive skills at 2 years. However, it is not yet known if antiviral medication is safe and effective for babies with only hearing loss as a symptom. CMV infection can have long-term effects on a child's development, and the full extent of these effects may not be known until the child is in school.

He has not been linked to ISIS and his motivations are unclear, but I am disturbed.	Dahir Ahmed Adan, a 20-year-old Somali refugee, was identified as the suspect in the stabbing spree at a Minnesota mall. He allegedly stabbed 10 people before being shot dead by an off-duty police officer. Adan was wearing a private security uniform and asked at least one person if they were Muslim while carrying out the stabbings. Although an ISIS-affiliated media outlet claimed responsibility, there is no evidence linking Adan to the terrorist group. Adan was described as a quiet and studious young man from a well-known local Somali family. He had recently called his soccer coach for weight-loss advice and was out of work after his part-time security guard job ended. Investigators are examining Adan's media accounts and electronic devices to determine his motive. Minnesota has the largest Somali community in the US, and community leaders expressed concern about potential backlash. The Somali community in Minnesota has been targeted by ISIS for recruitment, with several individuals convicted or charged with supporting the extremist group.

A study published in Plos One reveals that Americans waste a significant amount of food, with about 133 billion pounds of edible food going uneaten in 2010. Two-thirds of this waste is attributed to consumers. The paper highlights the negative environmental impact of food waste, as 95% of it ends up in landfills. Ohio State University professor Brian Roe suggests that increasing awareness of the issue can lead to purposeful action to reduce food waste. A national survey conducted last year found that 53% of Americans are aware of the problem, a 10% increase from a previous study. The survey also revealed that many people believe throwing away food after the package date reduces the risk of food-related illnesses and that some food waste is necessary for freshness. Additionally, 77% of respondents feel guilty about wasting food, while 58% understand the environmental consequences. However, 51% believe it is difficult to reduce home food waste, and 42% claim to lack the time to address the issue.

Thousands of residents have fled the eastern neighborhoods of Mosul, the city held by the Islamic State, in the first significant wave of people escaping since the offensive to retake the city began two weeks ago. Over 1.2 million people are still believed to be trapped in Mosul, while newly constructed camps in the area can only accommodate 60,000 people. The fleeing residents, including shepherds with their herds of sheep, are heading towards a camp for displaced people on the banks of the Khazir River. Some of those who escaped were visibly relieved, removing their black veils and waving V for victory as Iraqi and Kurdish troops passed by. The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, released an audio recording calling on his followers to remain steadfast and fight. Iraqi commanders believe it is only a matter of time before the city is recaptured, but the fate of the civilians trapped inside remains uncertain. The number of civilians fleeing has significantly increased as fighting moves into more densely populated neighborhoods. Iraqi forces are trying to keep families in their homes as much as possible to avoid a humanitarian crisis, but many people are choosing to flee as conflict approaches. The Iraqi forces are also searching houses for Islamic State fighters trying to hide among civilians.

It occurs when a person is awake and conscious but unable to move, except for their eyes. Sleep paralysis often involves nightmares or hallucinations and can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The causes of sleep paralysis are not fully understood, but stress and disruptions to sleep, such as alcohol or caffeine, can increase the risk. It can also be a symptom of other sleep disorders and mental health conditions. Kendall Jenner discussed her struggles with sleep paralysis, which may be linked to her anxiety and jet lag. Sleep paralysis is more common in people with mental health problems and young adults. For most people, it is not a chronic condition, but some individuals experience recurrent episodes. Practicing good sleep behaviors, such as avoiding alcohol and caffeine and sleeping on your side, can help prevent sleep paralysis. If it becomes a problem, a specialist may be able to prescribe medications to suppress REM sleep and alleviate symptoms.

But now that i read the article I can see the link between hormone fluctuations and mood disorders since the two effect each other.	A study from the University of Copenhagen has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study, which tracked one million Danish women for 13 years, found that women taking the combined oral contraceptive were 23% more likely to be diagnosed with depression, while those using progestin-only pills were 34% more likely. Teens were at the greatest risk, with an 80% increase in depression when taking the combined pill. Other hormone-based methods, such as the hormonal IUS/coil, the patch, and the ring, were shown to increase depression at a higher rate than oral contraceptives. The study suggests that the practice of encouraging teens to use these alternatives to the pill is misguided. The medical community's response to the study has been dismissive, with experts downplaying the link and offering paternalistic advice. The burden of avoiding unwanted pregnancy falls on women, despite the potential negative effects on their health and wellbeing. Effective alternatives to hormonal contraceptives exist, but they are often overlooked. It is important to remember that women are twice as likely to experience depression as men, and blaming women's depression on their biological femaleness is acceptable, but blaming medication formulated from synthetic hormones is not. The study's authors plan to research the possible association between hormonal birth control and suicide attempts or completions. While not every woman experiences depression and anxiety from hormonal contraceptives, it is important to acknowledge that many do, and their lives could be improved by recognizing and addressing this issue.

It's interesting to see how different things are over there.	At a global wildlife summit, a bid to provide the highest level of international legal protection to all African elephants was defeated. However, new measures were passed to add vital protection for elephants, including the closure of legal ivory markets within nations and tougher measures to deal with nations failing to control poached ivory. The debate over elephant poaching has divided African countries, with some arguing that making money from ivory sales and trophy hunting is necessary for protection, while others believe that poaching and the illegal ivory trade pose the greatest threat. Most African elephants already have the highest level of international legal protection, but elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Botswana have a lower level of protection. A proposal to upgrade these populations to the highest level of protection was defeated. The EU and some scientific and conservation groups opposed the upgrade, arguing that it did not meet the biological criteria. The issue of cutting the demand for ivory and better enforcement against poachers were highlighted as key solutions.

I know you don't go out much, but it doesn't take much to have a disaster to fall on your doorstep.	A prolonged drought in the southeast U.S. has led to numerous forest fires in the southern Appalachian Mountains. These fires have burned over 107,000 acres, with 37 fires covering at least 100 acres each. Arson is suspected in some cases. The fires have caused a hazy pall over northern Georgia, and officials have warned of unhealthy air quality. State firefighters are working to contain the fires and have urged people to avoid starting new ones. The drought has also affected water levels, with a popular state park's main attraction reduced to a trickle.

Actress Susan Sarandon has launched an online petition urging people to empty their bank accounts in protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The petition targets big banks such as Bank of America, HSBC, UBS, Wells Fargo, Chase, and Citibank, which are involved in supporting the pipeline. Sarandon argues that the pipeline will destroy sacred Native American sites and have severe environmental consequences. The petition asks signatories to withdraw their money and place it in credit unions until the banks divest and pressure the White House for an environmental impact statement. As of now, there is no evidence of people following through with the pledge.

The large Somali community in Minneapolis went through a rigorous screening process to enter the US, but younger generations are struggling to earn a living. Donald Trump's anti-immigrant stance is based on a false notion that the country's safety is at risk from Muslim extremists due to lax vetting policies. In reality, refugees face a lengthy screening process by the United Nations before coming to the US. However, once in the country, they receive limited support in terms of job-search help and cash assistance, making it difficult for them to integrate into the American economy. This lack of support contributes to refugee families' difficulty in escaping poverty and younger generations' sense of isolation.

Indigenous communities in Labrador, Canada are protesting the construction of a hydroelectric dam due to concerns about the release of methylmercury into Lake Melville, which would contaminate their food sources. A study from Harvard's environmental scientist, Elsie Sunderland, predicts that the dam will expose communities to double the amount of methylmercury they currently ingest, potentially causing acute poisoning. The dam's developer, Nalcor Energy, acknowledges that methylmercury levels will spike but claims they will eventually return to pre-dam levels. However, Sunderland's study contradicts this claim. The study also highlights that other hydroelectric projects in Canada pose similar risks to indigenous populations. Indigenous leaders and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador have reached a compromise to address the methylmercury impact, but specific measures have not been determined yet.

Protesters in New Delhi took to the streets to express their anger at the government's slow response to the city's severe air pollution crisis. The toxic smoke, caused by factors such as low winds, holiday fireworks residue, and crop-burning in neighboring states, has led to the closure of schools, canceled cricket matches, and a surge in patients with breathing problems. The air quality, measured by the PM 2.5 particulate pollutant, was more than six times the acceptable level. The city's chief minister announced emergency measures, including banning construction activity, limiting diesel-generator use, and closing a coal-fired power plant. However, experts argue that more long-term solutions are needed, such as expanding public transport and permanently closing aging coal-fired plants. The burning of crop waste in neighboring states is a major contributor to the pollution, and the government is being urged to take action. Protesters, including schoolchildren, are demanding immediate action to address the pollution crisis.

Yaffa Eliach, a Holocaust survivor and historian, passed away at the age of 81. She is known for her massive photography collection that memorializes the lives of Holocaust victims rather than focusing on their deaths. The collection, displayed in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, includes a photo of a young Yaffa Eliach taken on the day her home town was occupied by Germans. She was one of the few survivors from her town and spent years collecting photographs and documentation of every Jew who lived there. The collection became a principal exhibition at the Holocaust Museum and was installed in a tower. Eliach insisted that no photo be cropped, capturing people enjoying life before the massacre. She also wrote a book chronicling the history of her town. Eliach's work aimed to show the humanity of the victims and preserve their stories.

The region's remoteness made it challenging to provide emergency services, but rescue operations are underway. Pakistan's Prime Minister has condemned the blast and ordered authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice. This is not the first time ISIS has targeted Pakistan, as they previously attacked a police academy in Quetta, resulting in numerous casualties.

"A 13-year-old boy in Georgia had his right leg amputated after being repeatedly ""body slammed"" by a contractor at his school. The incident occurred when the boy tried to leave the classroom to call his mother. The school failed to provide adequate medical care and made the boy attempt to walk to the bus despite his injuries. The contractor involved in the incident, Bryant Mosley, is no longer providing services to the school district. The school district claims that the use of restraint was necessary for the safety of the child and others in the room. The boy's attorney argues that the method used was not part of the Georgia restraint guidance. The family plans to pursue a civil suit in the future."

Investors are becoming hesitant to invest in Ethiopia due to recent violent protests. The unrest, which began last year, has led to attacks on industrial farms and factories, particularly those with state ties or owned by foreigners. Ethiopia's industrialization program and economic growth are at risk as current investors reconsider their options and new ones shy away. The government declared a state of emergency in response to the violence, leading to concerns from international organizations. The government has promised to help investors recoup their losses, but the future remains uncertain. Many investors are waiting to see if the government can address the underlying issues causing the unrest.

By no means am I say we shouldn't make changes to solve climate change but it is interesting to seem how life is adapting to the changes.	Climate change has had a broad impact on ecosystems, with evidence of its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. A study identified 94 core ecological processes, of which 82% showed evidence of impact from climate change. These impacts range from shifts in species ranges and changes in phenology to disruptions at the genetic and ecosystem levels. Species are adapting to temperature extremes, with changes in physiology and morphology. Changes in phenology, abundance, and distribution of species have also been observed. These impacts have implications for food security, as reduced genetic diversity, inconsistent crop yields, and decreased productivity in fisheries threaten resources. Changes in disease vectors and the emergence of novel pathogens and pests pose a direct threat to human health and resources. Understanding these impacts is crucial for adapting to and mitigating the influence of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Some believe that some of these physicians and psychiatrist should bear the brunt of the blame for torture at Guantanamo Bay.	The mental health care provided to detainees at Guantánamo Bay has been compromised by a lack of training, ethical boundaries, and information about their treatment during interrogations. Psychiatrists and psychologists were often unaware of the abuse that had taken place, and were discouraged from asking detainees about their experiences. The quality of care has been criticized by human rights groups and defense teams, who argue that it has been negligent and ineffective. Many detainees suffer from psychological problems as a result of their treatment, but PTSD is rarely diagnosed due to the impracticality of treatment in the prison environment. The mental health personnel faced numerous challenges, including distrust from detainees and the blurred lines between medical care and interrogation. Despite these obstacles, they did their best to provide care to the prisoners.

The war in Aleppo, Syria has had a devastating impact on the city's older residents. Many of them are facing difficult circumstances, including food and medicine shortages, as well as neglect from their families. The siege imposed by pro-government forces has made it nearly impossible to find medicine to treat chronic diseases commonly experienced by older people. Overstretched medical facilities are unable to provide proper care, leading to more deaths. Some families have even abandoned their older family members due to the extreme conditions. The situation has left many older residents feeling weak, frightened, and helpless. Despite the dangers, some refuse to leave their homes, while others are trapped and unable to leave due to the siege. The older residents of Aleppo are struggling to balance their own needs with the demands of their families, often sacrificing their own well-being. The war has taken away their dignity and left them feeling isolated and afraid.

India's tiger population, which accounts for more than half of the world's total, has been rapidly declining due to human interference. While the population had been increasing in recent years, with 2,226 tigers in 2015 compared to 1,411 in 2005, this year has seen a significant increase in tiger deaths. 78 tigers have already died in the first 10 months of the year, surpassing the number of deaths in the same period over the past six years. The cause of some deaths is still being determined, but others have been attributed to human activities such as poaching, poisoning, electrocution, and road accidents. India has seized the largest number of tigers and tiger products, with 540 seizures between 2000 and 2015. The increase in tiger mortalities and seizures is a cause for concern, and experts emphasize the need for coordinated enforcement operations to combat illegal wildlife trade, which they describe as a transnational organized crime.

"Filmmaker and activist Michael Moore wrote a ""Morning After To-Do List"" for Democrats, urging them to fire pundits, pollsters, and media members who clung to an incorrect election narrative. He also called for Democrats to remove any members of Congress who aren't ready to fight and to remind people that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. Moore argued that Trump's victory was not a surprise, as he had predicted it in his film ""Michael Moore in TrumpLand."" He attributed Trump's success to the anger and despair of working-class Americans who have been neglected by both parties. Late night hosts offered a mix of encouraging messages and punchlines after the election."

The Supreme Court has halted the execution of an Alabama death row inmate, Thomas D. Arthur, for the seventh time. The execution was scheduled for Thursday evening but was stayed as officials waited for the Supreme Court to consider his appeals. Justice Clarence Thomas issued an order halting the execution until further notice. The court later granted Arthur's stay request, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voting in favor as a courtesy to his colleagues. The stay will remain in place until the justices decide whether to consider the case. Arthur was sentenced to death for the 1982 killing of Troy Wicker, the husband of a woman with whom Arthur had an affair. His attorneys argued against Alabama's lethal injection protocol and suggested execution by firing squad instead. The state's Department of Corrections is only allowed to carry out executions by injection and electrocution. Alabama's death penalty system has faced increased scrutiny following a Supreme Court ruling that struck down Florida's death penalty system.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has escalated his conflict with the Kurdish opposition by arresting at least eight members of parliament from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), including the party's two leaders. The arrests have been criticized as an assault on Turkey's democracy and have drawn condemnations from European capitals and the United Nations. The crackdown on political opponents follows a failed coup attempt in July, with tens of thousands of people being arrested or dismissed from their jobs. The government has also been targeting Kurdish opposition politicians, linking them to Kurdish militant groups. The arrests of HDP lawmakers are seen as a turning point in the government's campaign of arrests and have raised fears of greater instability in the country.

Let me know what you think.	"An animal-welfare organization called Four Paws recently rescued the remaining animals from a zoo near the Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis. The zoo, known as the ""world's worst zoo,"" had a history of neglect and animal deaths, including taxidermy of dead animals. The rescue mission was complicated due to the ongoing conflict in the region, but the team successfully evacuated the animals and transferred them to sanctuaries. The rescue has been hailed as a milestone in animal rights, but concerns remain about the wider issues of wildlife trafficking and the commercialization of wild animals in Gaza. The rescued animals will now receive care and rehabilitation in their new homes. There are hopes to create new legislation in Gaza to address these issues and prevent animal smuggling. The organization is also concerned about other zoos in conflict zones that require immediate attention."

ISIS has executed 232 people near Mosul and taken tens of thousands as human shields against advancing Iraqi forces, according to the United Nations. The terror group carried out mass killings as punishment for defying its orders. Since October 17, ISIS has taken tens of thousands of men, women, and children from the outskirts of Mosul into the city, intending to use them as human shields. Iraqi forces have launched an operation to cut ISIS supply lines west of Mosul. Reports indicate that ISIS has abducted thousands of families from various areas. The use of human shields is a violation of international humanitarian law. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned ISIS's strategy and urged those fighting ISIS not to carry out revenge attacks. The Mosul operation has already displaced thousands of people, and camps have been set up to accommodate them. Civilians continue to flee despite the risks involved.

Two girls in Myanmar who were kept prisoner and tortured for five years in a tailor shop have sparked outrage and an investigation. The police had previously refused to get involved despite pleas from the girls' families. The girls, who were sent to work in the shop at the ages of 11 and 12, were denied contact with their parents, not paid, and subjected to abuse. The case highlights the issue of child slavery in Myanmar, where at least a million children are forced to give up education and work. The authorities' handling of the case has angered the public, who see it as evidence of a biased judicial system. It was only when a journalist got involved that action was taken, leading to the arrest of the tailor and her two adult children. The president has ordered a report on how the police handled the case and is taking a closer look at the work of the human rights commission. The journalist involved is receiving a presidential award for his efforts.

A suspected serial killer in Anchorage, Alaska was stopped by a police officer who was responding to a theft complaint. The officer, Arn Salao, was shot multiple times by the suspect, James Dale Ritchie, but managed to return fire and fight off his assailant. Another officer arrived at the scene and also fired at Ritchie, killing him. Ballistics tests revealed that the gun Ritchie used was the same one used in five other homicides in Anchorage in 2016. Ritchie had prior arrests for drugs and burglary and had recently returned to Alaska from West Virginia. Two of the victims linked to Ritchie's gun were identified as Jason Netter Sr. and Brianna Foisy, who were found dead in July. Another two victims, Bryant De Husson and Kevin Schuyler Turner, were found dead in August. The motive behind the killings is unknown, and it is unclear if Ritchie knew any of the victims. The police believe that the chance encounter between Officer Salao and Ritchie may have saved countless lives. Two other unsolved double homicides in Anchorage have not been linked to Ritchie.

Women are concerned about the potential threat to affordable birth control under the Trump-Pence administration. Trump and Pence have expressed intentions to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which covers birth control. In response, some women are considering getting an intrauterine device (IUD) as a long-lasting form of birth control that could outlast any changes made by the administration. IUDs are highly effective and safe, with some versions lasting up to 12 years. Women are advised to take action soon, as an IUD can cost up to $1,000 without insurance coverage. Planned Parenthood offers a guide for those interested in learning more about IUDs. The fate of the Affordable Care Act and its birth control provisions is uncertain after President Obama leaves office on January 20, 2017.

The exhibit has been attended by over 17,000 people, including 3,400 students. MSF hopes to communicate the reality of the refugee crisis and generate empathy in a time when anti-refugee sentiment is on the rise. The exhibit creates an empathetic response by assigning each participant a specific displaced person's identity and sharing personal stories from aid-workers who have served in MSF camps. The exhibit challenges the notion that empathy is a globalized response, as humans are wired to empathize with those in their immediate surroundings. However, empathy can be strengthened with practice and training programs have shown promise in changing people's responses to others' suffering. While empathy alone is not a solution to the refugee crisis, it is a necessary component in finding a genuine solution.

Over 60% of these species are listed as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered due to factors such as trading, collection for food and medicine, and habitat degradation. The study used climate models and the fossil record to investigate the impact of long-term climate change on these species. Results show that turtles and tortoises were able to withstand warmer climates in the past as long as there was enough water to support them. However, they are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, making climate change a significant threat to their conservation status.

The Obama administration has announced that it will resume deportations of undocumented Haitian immigrants due to a surge in Haitian migrants seeking to enter the United States. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, deportations were suspended, but they were partially resumed later on for those convicted of serious crimes or considered a threat to national security. However, since last spring, thousands of Haitian migrants who had moved to Brazil for work have been making their way to the United States. These migrants have been allowed to enter the country and given permission to stay for up to three years under a humanitarian parole provision. With the full resumption of deportations, Haitians without visas will now be put into expedited removal proceedings. The surge in Haitian migrants has overwhelmed shelters in Tijuana, and many migrants have chosen to sleep on the streets. The change in American policy has surprised advocates in San Diego and Tijuana, who object to the policy change that does not reflect any actual change in reality.

The Islamic State (ISIS) has used a rocket containing mustard gas against U.S. troops in Iraq, according to a top U.S. military official. This is the first time a chemical weapon has been used against U.S. forces in Iraq, although ISIS has previously used chemical weapons. The U.S. military recently attacked a former pharmaceutical plant near Mosul that ISIS was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals. No soldiers were injured in the attack, and there have been no symptoms of exposure to mustard gas. Both ISIS and President Bashar al-Assad in Syria have been accused of using chemical weapons. The fighting around Mosul is expected to intensify as Iraqi forces, supported by U.S. soldiers, advance into the city.

A new study suggesting that Earth could be doomed to warming of up to 13 degrees Fahrenheit is being dismissed as flawed by climate scientists. The study, published in Nature, offers a reconstruction of global sea-surface temperatures for the past two million years. However, several top scientists argue that the author's conclusions about catastrophic temperature rise are not supported by the data. They claim that the study's author made a fundamental mistake in her analysis. Other scientists also criticize the study for extrapolating from past ice ages to the present climate. NASA's chief climate scientist states that if greenhouse gas levels stay the same, temperatures may rise an additional 0.5 to 1 degree Celsius, not 7 degrees. The study's author defends her work, stating that it shows a close relationship between temperature and greenhouse gases. However, critics argue that her method is not the way to determine the Earth's sensitivity to CO2. The question of how sensitive Earth's climate will be to CO2 emissions remains open. In a separate article, a congressional committee reveals that sexual harassment and bullying among National Park Service employees at iconic parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone has been pervasive and ongoing for years. Whistleblowers detailed several alleged offenses, including stalking and inappropriate behavior by supervisors. The Park Service has vowed to end harassment and is working to change its culture.

The US military has admitted that civilians were likely killed in a joint Afghan-US operation in Kunduz, Afghanistan. The operation targeted Taliban leaders planning attacks in the city. Alongside the 30 civilians, two US service members were also killed. The US military expressed regret for the loss of innocent lives and promised to investigate the incident. Afghan forces, with US military advice, conducted the operation and encountered significant enemy fire. In addition to the civilian casualties, four members of Afghan special forces were killed, and 26 insurgents were killed. The Pentagon identified the dead US service members and expressed condolences. The incident occurred on the same day as a Taliban mortar attack that killed seven people attending a wedding party. In April, the Pentagon announced disciplinary action for a fatal US strike on a Kunduz hospital in 2015. The strike was deemed unintentional human error and equipment failure, rather than a war crime.

"This year is on track to be the warmest on record, and if carbon emissions continue to rise, record hot years will become the ""new normal"" by 2025. The damage has already been done, and the global average temperature of 2015 will be the norm by 2040. Extreme seasons will become the norm within decades if emissions continue as usual. However, there is still hope to prevent record-breaking heat at a seasonal and regional level with immediate action on carbon emissions. The Paris climate agreement's proposed emissions cuts are not enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. To keep global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius, emissions need to be slashed by an additional 25 percent by 2030. Despite concerns about President-elect Donald Trump's stance on climate change, world leaders and activists remain committed to battling climate change."

It sounds better for their employees.	Former Wells Fargo employees have described the mental health nightmares they experienced while working at the bank. Many employees suffered from stress-induced migraines, severe anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems due to the high-pressure work environment and unethical practices. Some employees were rewarded for using unethical practices to meet unrealistic sales goals, while others were constantly observed and critiqued by managers. The experiences of these employees highlight the toll that a toxic work culture can have on mental health. Wells Fargo has acknowledged its failures and is making changes to support its employees and uphold a customer-focused culture. The extreme stress and involvement in illegal activity can worsen mental health problems. Even managers at the bank experienced severe depression and anxiety. The mental health nightmares extended to employees in the mortgage division as well, with bullying, punishment, and intimidation being common. Employees were constantly measured against each other and bonuses were sometimes blocked. The lack of compassion from supervisors during personal crises led some employees to quit. The experiences of these employees have left a lasting impact on their mental health and perception of Wells Fargo.

Record-breaking temperatures this summer have raised concerns about the impact of climate change on the region. Even if warming is limited to 2°C, the Mediterranean region would still experience unprecedented changes. Morocco could face increased temperatures and drought, leading to the displacement of forests and expansion of deserts. The fossil fuel industry's recklessness is pushing the planet towards catastrophe, and urgent action is needed to address this. Governments must divest from climate destruction and invest in renewable energy. Ending fossil fuel subsidies and removing the industry's influence from climate talks are crucial steps. Legal action is also being taken against major carbon emitters. The demand to world leaders is to stop new fossil fuel projects and transition to 100% renewable energy.

I mean, maybe we can develop some kind of methane collection system and then use the cow farts to power the world. Talk about renewable energy!	Cows release methane gas, a greenhouse gas, which has a much higher negative effect on the climate compared to carbon dioxide. The livestock industry, including cattle breeding and farming, is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector. Livestock pastures and feed production use a significant portion of the Earth's land surface, leading to deforestation and habitat loss. The increasing demand for meat and dairy products contributes to the overgrowth of the farming industry and its impact on global warming. Producing one kilogram of beef emits an equivalent amount of CO2 as an average European car every 250 kilometers and consumes a significant amount of energy. Consuming less meat and dairy products is an effective way to reduce one's carbon footprint and protect the environment.

"Former Democratic senator Evan Bayh is facing a tough race against Republican candidate Todd Young in Indiana. Bayh has been attacked for his multiple homes, high earnings, and corporate ties. However, he still has a chance of winning, with recent polls showing a statistical tie between him and Young. Republicans are facing a cash crunch, with Bayh having a significant edge in ad spending. If Bayh wins, it would be a significant blow to GOP chances of holding their majority in the Senate. Bayh's entrance into the race was seen as a recruiting coup for the Democrats, and his bipartisan appeal has given him an advantage. Young's pitch is that Bayh has transformed from a centrist to a supporter of President Obama's agenda, using his positions to land post-Senate business. The attacks on Bayh's wealth resonate in Indiana, where the culture is parochial and politicians often emphasize their ""Hoosier"" identity. Bayh wants the race to focus on his accomplishments, such as the Evan Bayh 21st Century Scholars Program. However, the race has become increasingly negative, with outside groups playing a significant role."

The protest against the Dakota Access pipeline has grown to include thousands of Native Americans from hundreds of tribes. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is concerned about the pipeline potentially contaminating their water supply and violating historical and cultural sites. The protests gained national attention when private security used dogs and pepper spray on protesters. A federal judge has halted the pipeline's construction, and museum workers and archaeologists have called for a more thorough review of the potential risk to artifacts. Native Americans from across the country have joined the protest, aiming to stop the pipeline and protect the environment. The protest continues both on-site and online.

This incident brings attention to the attacks on priests in Mexico, with two others being found shot to death after being kidnapped. While robbery is suggested as the motive for the killings, fellow priests believe there may be other factors involved. The priest had been threatened recently due to his activism and criticism of corruption and crime in the area. This incident sparked unrest in the town of Catemaco, where residents demanded the priest's release. Mexico has seen the killing of 31 priests since 2006, with Veracruz, Guerrero, and Mexico states being the most dangerous for priests due to drug cartel violence.

Violence has escalated between Myanmar's security forces and the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim population. Two soldiers were killed by attackers armed with guns, knives, and spears. In retaliation, the government used helicopters to fire at the attackers. The area is closed to Western journalists, making it difficult to verify the scale of the fighting. The Rohingya have been under siege since the government sent security forces to hunt for armed Rohingya assailants who had killed nine police officers. Human rights groups have received reports of killings, rapes, and beatings of Rohingya civilians. Western diplomats have called for an independent investigation into the violence, but Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has declined. The Rohingya population has been subjected to decades of repression, making them susceptible to radicalization. The government's harsh proposals may have been the catalyst for the recent attacks. The Rohingya villages have become armed camps, with reports of food scarcity, curfews, and rape by soldiers. Myanmar officials deny the occurrence of rapes.

Although there were no reports of serious injuries or deaths, the aftershocks revealed structural weaknesses in the area and added to the psychological stress of the residents. The government has allocated 40 million euros for housing those displaced by the quakes and promised to begin reconstruction soon.

Germany, which took in more asylum seekers than the rest of Europe combined, is facing the challenge of deciding who gets to stay. Syrians and Iraqis are almost guaranteed sanctuary, while Nigerians and Pakistanis are more likely to have their claims rejected. Even Syrians are increasingly falling short of winning full refugee status. Critics argue that asylum officials are turning a deaf ear to genuine petitions from asylum seekers arriving from countries outside the Middle East war zones. The German government is increasingly targeting migrants deemed ineligible for protection and is enforcing deportation more strictly. The system is flawed, with many appeals against the Federal Office's decisions and concerns about inexperienced decision-makers and declining interpreter quality.

Mexicans are concerned about the economic damage that a Trump presidency might bring, particularly his promises to rewrite the trade deal and deport millions of unauthorized immigrants. Mexico's top economic officials tried to calm fears, stating that Mexico was in a strong economic position. The peso dropped in value after Trump's win appeared imminent. President Enrique Peña Nieto expressed his willingness to work with Trump. Mexicans are unsure if Trump's words will match his actions as president. Some economists predict a recession if Trump pursues his outlined plans. Mexicans are also worried about the deportation of illegal immigrants. The election has reshuffled Mexico's domestic politics, with a potential nationalist backlash in the upcoming presidential election.

The U.S. Embassy in Amman stated that they are in contact with Jordanian authorities and do not believe the incident was terrorism-related.

This stress is not limited to any particular political party and is exacerbated by social media posts, which can range from factual to inflammatory. Additionally, 38% of adults say that cultural and political discussions on social media cause them stress. The APA has provided a list of do's and don'ts for reading and reacting to election news. The stress trend is expected to continue until mid-November, as more people rely on online sources for news. While cable TV news remains the top source of election news, more millennials are turning to alternative sources for information.

The squirrels were found to have two different species of leprosy bacterium, one of which is almost identical to a strain recovered from a medieval human skeleton. There is currently no evidence of squirrel-to-human transmission, but researchers are concerned about the health of the endangered red squirrels. The reason why squirrels, humans, and armadillos are the only known species to harbor the bacterium is still unknown. The discovery of leprosy in squirrels may help researchers understand how the disease manifests in humans and how it spreads.

Many students are absent because their families cannot afford to buy food. One teacher reported that a student skipped class every Thursday because it was their family's designated day to buy food at government-regulated prices. Another teacher witnessed a child faint during a cultural event because they had only eaten an arepa at 10 a.m. and it was already 3 p.m. The government spends very little on meals in public schools, and a lawmaker criticized the government for prioritizing weapons over food. A recent poll revealed that 48% of the time children do not attend school, it is due to food-related issues. Many children eat only twice a day or even just once, and for some, the school lunch is their only meal of the day. Some parents are considering changing their children from private to public schools, while others are contemplating taking their children out of school altogether. In addition to the food crisis, public schools are also facing infrastructure problems, with stolen computers and desks and a lack of funds for school supplies.

"The US is facing an ""innovation crisis"" as other countries outperform it in measures of innovation. Economists attribute this decline to burdensome regulations and a weak job market. Some argue that the US's focus on individual self-reliance and smaller social safety net may discourage risk-taking. Studies show that demand-side factors, such as job insecurity and middling wage growth, are affecting entrepreneurship. Canada's maternity leave reform and France's unemployment insurance reform offer potential solutions to boost entrepreneurship. Policies that promote a tight labor market and full employment are crucial for the future strength of the US economy."

The students were intercepted by local police and handed over to a drug cartel while hijacking buses in 2014.

One father believes his son and the others are still alive and that the families will never trust the government.

Islamic State fighters launched a series of car bomb attacks in northern Syria as U.S.-backed forces began their push to retake Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State. The operation aims to isolate Raqqa and cut off supply routes for the militants. The car bomb attacks were a preview of the fierce battle that lies ahead. The U.S.-led coalition conducted airstrikes in support of the offensive. However, the U.S. also sought to calm Turkey, which is concerned about the increased influence of Kurdish groups in the region. The Obama administration faces the challenge of balancing its relationship with Turkey and the Syrian Kurdish forces it supports. Talks were held to secure Turkish support for the operation and to reassure Ankara that the offensive would not benefit Syrian Kurds.

The fact that the lack of sleep and quality sleep can lead to a higher risk of stroke is very alarming. So many people need to seek help for sleep disorders, because where the disorder itself may not cause major health issues, it can lead to major health issues.	A new review suggests that sleep disorders increase the risk of stroke and affect recovery. The study found a link between sleep breathing problems and stroke risk and recovery, but less evidence for the link between sleep-wake disorders and stroke. People with sleep disorders may be more likely to have another stroke or other health problems. For those with sleep apnea, treatment with a continuous positive airway pressure machine (CPAP) is recommended. A CDC report shows that a significant number of Americans have sleep disorders, indicating a need for public awareness and education about the importance of sleep.

Many patients avoid colonoscopies due to the unpleasant preparation process, which involves drinking a salty, repulsive-tasting drink and laxative. However, a Boston-based company called ColonaryConcepts is developing bowel-clearing food bars and drinks that taste more like fruit smoothies and chocolate. These products have been tested in a phase 2 trial and have shown promising results in terms of effectiveness and patient satisfaction. The new colonoscopy prep is scheduled to begin phase 3 trials next year and could potentially enter the market in 2018. This alternative option aims to improve the tolerability and cleansing effect of the preparation process. It is important for patients to not put off colonoscopies, as they are crucial for detecting and preventing colon cancer.

Elephant eats tropical food instead of hey.	The economic crisis in Venezuela has led to a shortage of food, affecting both people and animals. Around 50 animals at Caricuao Zoo have starved in the last six months due to the rising cost of food caused by the economic downturn. The country's inability to import food and other necessities, along with skyrocketing inflation, has led to widespread hunger. Zoo staff have resorted to feeding carnivorous animals fruits and vegetables, and even slaughtered horses. The malnourishment of animals can have long-lasting health effects, including psychological issues. Other zoos in Venezuela are also struggling to feed their animals and are seeking donations. The situation in Venezuela is not unique, as animals in other countries, such as Gaza and Yemen, are also suffering due to poor social climates and conflicts. Animal rights organizations are working to address these issues and provide assistance to the affected animals.

Other research has also shown little to no gains in student achievement with improved computer access. Despite this, the program has continued to receive funding and has been plagued with fraud and lax oversight. Additionally, the push for more advanced networks and expensive technology may not be necessary, as many educational resources do not require high bandwidth connections. The funding for E-Rate comes from a tax on long distance telecommunications, which disproportionately affects lower-income households. The article suggests suspending the program until its effectiveness can be objectively tested, and exploring other options for using the funds.

A security crackdown in northern Rakhine state, Burma, following militant attacks has worsened the humanitarian situation and drawn international attention to Aung San Suu Kyi's government. The government has accused the Rohingya Muslim community of being behind the attacks, leading to a manhunt and reports of abuse by the military. The United Nations and the US have called for investigations into the alleged abuse and the restoration of humanitarian access. Human Rights Watch has reported burned villages and alleged rape of Muslim women by soldiers. The crisis is seen as a major test for Suu Kyi's new government, which is accused of not doing enough to address the Rohingya crisis. The Rohingya, who are essentially stateless, are considered illegal immigrants by many in the Buddhist-majority country. The security crackdown has displaced thousands of people and disrupted access to healthcare and food assistance. Suu Kyi has called for strengthening border security, following the rule of law, and creating a development plan for the area. However, the Rohingya community does not believe there is a militant group operating in the state and accuses the government of deliberate assassination. The crisis has further eroded confidence in Suu Kyi's government among the affected population.

So I feel we as people have no right to glare at the survival of the discarded lives that were no longer wanted. I say,'You go goldfish! Live your best lives!'	Goldfish that are released into the wild can become invasive and cause serious ecological damage. In Australia's Vasse River, goldfish have thrived and grown to large sizes, with some reaching 16 inches and four pounds. Goldfish invasions have also been reported in other places like Nevada, Colorado, and Alberta. The growth rate of goldfish in the Vasse River is the fastest known in the world. The problem with goldfish invasions stems from a disconnect between how people view goldfish as cute pets and their behavior in the wild. Goldfish are capable of rapid reproduction, uprooting vegetation, disturbing sediment, and transmitting diseases and parasites. Eradicating goldfish is difficult once they are established. Recent research has shown that goldfish are long-distance swimmers and migrate to spawn. Understanding goldfish behavior can help inform management strategies. It is crucial for pet owners to responsibly dispose of unwanted fish to prevent further invasions. Flushing fish down the toilet is not recommended.

Thompson criticized Johnson for focusing on the construction of the Golden 1 Center instead of projects that benefit the community. Johnson's Chief of Staff denied claims that the mayor violently attacked Thompson. Thompson expressed regret for promoting violence but still stands by his actions. He believes the money spent on the arena should have been used for public schools, community development, or helping the homeless. Thompson stated that he would pie the mayor again if given the chance.

A Saudi student, Hussain Saeed Alnahdi, was killed in a college town in Wisconsin. The police arrived to find him unconscious and bleeding, but have yet to identify a suspect or determine the motive. The incident has sparked allegations of a hate crime, given the rise in anti-Muslim sentiment during the presidential race. Alnahdi was well-liked and had quickly become part of the community. Saudi students make up a significant portion of the international student body at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. There have been reports of anti-Muslim harassment in nearby areas, but the town's administrators and police claim to be unaware of any racial tensions or prejudice.

Luckily they eat a lot of people keeping a close eye the sea levels and working on how to slow the warming of our planet.	A new study from the University of Washington, funded by NASA and other agencies, reveals that all 19 polar bear populations across the Arctic are facing a shorter sea ice season. The study, which is the first to quantify the sea ice changes in each polar bear subpopulation, shows a trend towards earlier sea ice melt in the spring and later ice growth in the fall. These changes negatively impact the feeding and breeding capabilities of the bears, as they rely on the sea ice for essential activities such as hunting and traveling. The study also found that the critical timing of the sea ice break-up and freeze-up is changing in all areas, which is harmful for polar bears. The researchers recommend that the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance be incorporated as measures of climate change in future reports.

A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals that 90% of seabirds currently eat plastic in the ocean, and by 2050, virtually all seabirds will be consuming it. The research explains that seabirds rely on their sense of smell to hunt for food, and the scent emitted by plastic in the ocean tricks them into confusing it with food. The study also found that birds that track the scent of a sulfurous compound emitted by algae, which coats floating plastic, are six times more likely to consume plastic. The research sheds light on species that are often overlooked, such as petrels and shearwaters, which are impacted by plastic ingestion. The study highlights the need to address the growing plastic pollution in oceans, which affects not only seabirds but also sea turtles, fish, and other marine animals. The problem of plastic pollution starts on land, with nonpoint source pollution being one of the biggest contributors. The top five countries that dump plastics into oceans are China, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand.

"With two weeks to go, Donald Trump's chances of winning the election are almost closed. Hillary Clinton is ahead in states worth more than 270 electoral votes. The focus now is on how many down-ballot Republicans Trump will drag down with him. Republican operatives and conservative radio hosts have declared that Trump is done and there is little he can do to turn it around. Trump's deficits in national and swing state polls are unprecedented, and his ground game is weak compared to Clinton's. Early voting numbers in Arizona and the shrinking advantage of Republicans in Florida and North Carolina indicate a potential win for Clinton. However, Democrats are not taking the outcome for granted and are working hard to mobilize voters. Trump's refusal to accept the voting results and his controversial remarks have galvanized Clinton's supporters. Trump's blaming of a globalist conspiracy and claims of a rigged election have raised concerns about the integrity of the election system. Trump's downward spiral has also affected House Republicans and vulnerable Senate candidates. Overall, Republicans are scared and the race has become a ""horror show"" for them."

A man in Alabama was sentenced to 40 years in prison for murdering his daughter's sexual abuser, 13 years after the abuser's release from prison. The victim, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, expressed her anger and frustration at the abuser's short sentence. The father, driven by rage and a desire for vengeance, shot and killed the abuser. The father pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and also pleaded guilty to attempted murder of another man. The father's actions sparked a debate online, with some supporting him and others condemning his actions. The daughter praised her father for protecting her and sparing her from having to relive the abuse in court. However, not everyone believed the father was justified, and some criticized his actions as endangering innocent lives. The daughter, despite her father's intentions, still feels guilt and is struggling emotionally.

Hopefully, the Tigers will be better protected in the future and people will stop trying to kill them or dial it down at least. I wish India's tigers the best in their protection and survival.	India's tiger population, which accounts for more than half of the world's total, has been rapidly declining due to human interference. While the population had been increasing in recent years, with 2,226 tigers in 2015 compared to 1,411 in 2005, this year has seen a significant increase in tiger deaths. 78 tigers have already died in the first 10 months of the year, surpassing the number of deaths in the same period over the past six years. The cause of some deaths is still being determined, but others have been attributed to human activities such as poaching, poisoning, electrocution, and road accidents. India has seized the largest number of tigers and tiger products, with 540 seizures between 2000 and 2015. The increase in tiger mortalities and seizures is a cause for concern, and experts emphasize the need for coordinated enforcement operations to combat illegal wildlife trade, which they describe as a transnational organized crime.

Although I didn't really have much concern for the article I just read, I hope that these protests will end in South Korea.	Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans took to the streets in Seoul for the second consecutive weekend, demanding the resignation of President Park Geun-hye. The protests were sparked by Park's admission that she shared classified information with someone lacking security clearance. The demonstrations, which included families, students, and union members, were some of the largest anti-government protests in decades. Four officers and 26 protesters were injured during the protests. Park's spokesman stated that she realizes the seriousness of the situation and is considering ways to normalize affairs. Protesters are calling for Park's resignation due to feelings of betrayal and frustration with her leadership. The protests also stem from other incidents, such as the Sewol ferry sinking. Despite roadblocks, protesters attempted to march to the presidential palace. The demonstrations will continue until there are answers and a resolution to the political turmoil.

The Zika virus has been known to scientists for decades, but it has only recently become a serious public health concern. The majority of infected individuals do not experience symptoms, making it difficult to test for. Pregnant women are particularly at risk, as the virus can cause birth defects. Zika primarily spreads through infected mosquitoes, but it can also be transmitted through sexual contact. There is currently no vaccine or treatment for Zika, but scientists are making progress in developing them. The virus is prevalent in many countries, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Zika was first discovered in monkeys in Uganda in 1947 and has since spread to various parts of the world. In the United States, there have been thousands of cases, with Puerto Rico being heavily affected. The CDC has issued travel warnings for Zika in many countries.

"Mayor Samsudin Dimaukom of Datu Saudi-Ampatuan, a Muslim autonomous area of Mindanao in the Philippines, was killed in a shootout with local authorities. He was on President Rodrigo Duterte's list of ""narco-politicians"" with alleged ties to the illegal drug world. Dimaukom and his wife had previously surrendered to the police to deny involvement. During a highway roadblock, an armed encounter occurred between Dimaukom's men and the police, resulting in the deaths of 10 men. Duterte's administration has been conducting a violent war on drugs, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of drug suspects by the police and vigilantes. Critics argue that the police are acting with impunity. Dimaukom is not the first elected official implicated in the drug war. The Senate Committee in the Philippines, led by a Duterte ally, decided to stop investigating extrajudicial killings of drug dealers and users."

Over 14,000 Saudi women have signed a petition calling for an end to the country's male guardianship system, which requires women to have the consent of a male guardian for various activities. The campaign gained support online through a trending Twitter hashtag. Women in Saudi Arabia must obtain permission from a male relative for activities such as traveling, working, studying, and even leaving the country. The petition was delivered to the government, and the activists are awaiting a response. The male guardianship system also affects women's ability to rent a flat, seek medical treatment, or file a legal claim. The campaign has received an incredible response, with hundreds of women bombarding the Saudi King's office with telegrams supporting the cause. However, there is opposition from some Saudi women who argue for reforming the system. The activists are demanding that women be treated as full citizens and that an age between 18 and 21 be designated as the point at which a woman is considered an adult. There has been no official response to the petition yet.

The CDC warns that sleeping in contact lenses can increase the risk of infections, and wearers of daily disposable lenses have a lower risk.

People should be more dedicated to animals and the environment and if they don't feel prepared to take care of a pet then they should just, not get one. This is why goldfish are invading Australia. Invasive species are extremely problematic to the ecosystem and combating them is difficult and expensive.	Goldfish that are released into the wild can become invasive and cause serious ecological damage. In Australia's Vasse River, goldfish have thrived and grown to large sizes, with some reaching 16 inches and four pounds. Goldfish invasions have also been reported in other places like Nevada, Colorado, and Alberta. The growth rate of goldfish in the Vasse River is the fastest known in the world. The problem with goldfish invasions stems from a disconnect between how people view goldfish as cute pets and their behavior in the wild. Goldfish are capable of rapid reproduction, uprooting vegetation, disturbing sediment, and transmitting diseases and parasites. Eradicating goldfish is difficult once they are established. Recent research has shown that goldfish are long-distance swimmers and migrate to spawn. Understanding goldfish behavior can help inform management strategies. It is crucial for pet owners to responsibly dispose of unwanted fish to prevent further invasions. Flushing fish down the toilet is not recommended.

Islamic State militants in Iraq are kidnapping thousands of villagers and using them as human shields as they retreat towards Mosul. Those who refuse to comply are shot, while others are taken but manage to escape. The militants are also executing former policemen and army officers out of paranoia. This tactic of holding civilians hostage complicates the U.S.-led airstrikes and puts civilians at risk of being caught in crossfire. The militants have also set fire to oil wells and a sulfur plant, causing noxious fumes. As Iraqi forces advance towards Mosul, the militants are expected to put up a tough fight.

A federal report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has concluded that the barrier separating humans and primates at the Cincinnati Zoo was not in compliance with standards for housing primates when a child fell into the gorilla exhibit in May. The report issued a critical citation because the barrier failed and caused harm to an animal. However, before the incident, the zoo had not been cited for shortcomings with the barrier during previous inspections. The zoo has since updated the barrier and is now in compliance with federal standards. The family of the child who entered the enclosure has stated that they do not want to pursue legal action against the zoo. The USDA has issued 10 citations at the zoo in the last three years, but none were related to the gorilla exhibit. The Cincinnati Zoo officials have reaffirmed their commitment to the well-being of the animals and the safety of visitors. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) has stated that the zoo meets their standards related to barriers.

A deadly outbreak of bloodstream infections in Wisconsin has left health officials puzzled. The infections, caused by a species of bacteria called Elizabethkingia anophelis, have killed 15 people and sickened 33 others. The microbe is resistant to common antibiotics, making treatment difficult. The outbreak is unusual because the bacteria is typically found in hospitals, but many of the infected individuals have not had recent contact with healthcare facilities. Investigators are testing various products for contamination as a possible source. The outbreak is challenging to understand as little is known about Elizabethkingia. The bacteria is commonly found in soil and mosquitoes, and it thrives in moist biofilms. Previous outbreaks have been linked to contaminated taps in hospitals. The current outbreak is the first reported of this particular species of Elizabethkingia. Officials believe it is unlikely that the contamination comes from tap or groundwater, but the source remains unknown.

The New York City Police Department released a video of a man suspected of setting fire to the woman's blouse. The woman, a Scottish tourist, felt something warm on her arm and realized her blouse was on fire. She saw a man holding a lighter who then ran away. The incident occurred just days after two Muslim women were attacked in Brooklyn. The attacker in that case was charged with felony assault as a hate crime. Additionally, a mosque in Orlando, Florida was set on fire during the start of a Muslim holiday. The Council on American-Islamic Relations called on city officials to address attacks against Muslims.

Trump's policies could have catastrophic effects on the planet's climate. By withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and terminating President Obama's Clean Power Plan, Trump could push global temperatures to rise higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius, leading to devastating consequences such as extreme weather patterns and mass extinctions. While other countries are committed to their climate commitments, Trump's actions could encourage them to abandon their commitments and emit more greenhouse gases. Trump's denial of climate change and his intention to cut off American support for UN climate science further exacerbate the situation. However, climate activists and environmental leaders are determined to continue their efforts at the local and state levels, pushing for emissions-restriction plans and the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure. Despite the divisions between Democrats and Republicans on climate policy, there is bipartisan support for investments in clean energy and climate resilience. The construction of wind and solar power plants could not only address climate change but also boost U.S. manufacturing and reduce electricity costs. The willingness of Trump and Republican leaders to support such initiatives remains uncertain.

The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline received a significant increase in calls, with the volume being two to three times higher than usual. The Crisis Text Line also experienced a surge in texts, with eight times the normal volume. The Trevor Project, which provides support to LGBTQ youth, saw a doubling of call volume, with more than 95% of callers discussing the election. The Trans Lifeline, which supports the transgender community, has been flooded with calls since the election, receiving more than 500 calls a day. The election results have caused panic and fear among callers, particularly regarding the potential loss of insurance and trans-affirming healthcare. These crisis hotlines are urging people to support each other, get back to routines, and limit exposure to media that exacerbates feelings of hopelessness. Acts of kindness and compassion are also encouraged to help alleviate anxiety.

A new report by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) reveals that over 18 million Americans are supplied with drinking water that violates federal laws on lead content. The report states that the water crisis in Flint, Michigan is not an isolated incident, and that violations of national rules protecting against lead contamination are widespread. The NRDC's analysis of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows that 5,363 water systems, serving more than 18 million people, breached the federal Lead and Copper Rule in 2015. These violations include inadequate testing for lead and insufficient treatment to prevent lead from leaching into the water supply. The violations occurred in almost every state, with 1,110 community water utilities providing water that exceeded the EPA's actionable limit for lead. Despite the widespread failure of water suppliers, very few were punished by the EPA last year. Of the over 8,000 violations, enforcement action was only taken against 11% of cases, and penalties were sought for just 3% of violations. The EPA has acknowledged the challenges in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule and has intensified work with state drinking water programs. However, a revised rule will not be implemented until 2017 at the earliest. The NRDC emphasizes that unsafe drinking water is a national problem that requires a national solution. The failure of the system to detect violations is highlighted by the fact that Flint was not considered in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule last year, despite the well-known water crisis. The CDC has reported that lead levels in the blood of Flint children significantly increased after the city switched its water supply. The NRDC also revealed that water utilities often manipulate test results to downplay lead levels. The Guardian has reported that at least 33 US cities have used methods to mask the true level of lead in water tests. The report raises concerns about the extent of the issue and calls for a coordinated effort at all levels to prevent future crises.

Teach for America, an organization that recruits and trains teachers for schools serving underprivileged students, is preparing for the potential end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program under the Trump administration. The organization has 146 teachers who are not documented citizens and are protected under DACA. Viridiana Carrizales, who planned for a Trump presidency, has developed a plan to help these teachers relocate and navigate immigration issues. Teach for America got involved in immigration policy in 2012 when they lobbied for the DREAM Act. When DACA became an option in 2014, Teach for America provided resources to help aspiring teachers go through the approval process. The status of these teachers is causing concern for the organization's top executive, Elisa Villanueva Beard. Teach for America teachers with DACA status also have undocumented students in their classes and discuss these issues in a private Facebook group. Carrizales, who came to the US illegally from Mexico, worries about the 146 DACAmented teachers and their families. Despite the sadness and fear among the teachers, there is a sense of resilience and determination to come through stronger.

Hillary Clinton is ahead in states worth more than 270 electoral votes. The focus now is on how many down-ballot Republicans Trump will drag down with him. Republican operatives and conservative radio hosts have declared that Trump is done and there is little he can do to turn it around. Trump's deficits in national and swing state polls are unprecedented, and his ground game is weak compared to Clinton's. Early voting numbers in Arizona and the shrinking advantage of Republicans in Florida and North Carolina indicate a potential win for Clinton. However, Democrats are not taking the outcome for granted and are working hard to mobilize voters. Trump's refusal to accept the voting results and his controversial remarks have galvanized Clinton's supporters. Trump's blaming of a globalist conspiracy and claims of a rigged election have raised concerns about the integrity of the election system. Trump's downward spiral has also affected House Republicans and vulnerable Senate candidates. Overall, Republicans are scared and the race has become a ""horror show"" for them."

Inmates at Lewisburg federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania are forced to live with violent cellmates or be placed in restraints. Inmates have no say in who they share a cell with, even if the cellmate has a violent history or severe mental illness. If they refuse a cellmate, they are placed in restraints for hours or days. Restraints are also used as punishment for inmates who break rules or get into fights. The conditions in the Special Management Unit (SMU) at Lewisburg are harsh, with inmates spending nearly 24 hours a day in small cells with little room to move. In 2014 and 2015, there were 228 in-cell fights and assaults at Lewisburg, resulting in injuries and even deaths. The use of restraints at Lewisburg has been criticized by inmates, lawyers, and auditors, but the Bureau of Prisons denies any mistreatment. Changes have been made to the SMU, but the use of restraints remains unchanged. Inmates are left with few options: accept a violent cellmate or be restrained.

I would guess by this article that since boys that are born using this method also have low sperm counts, that something, or someone, somewhere, is trying to tell them something.	A recent study suggests that men conceived through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a type of in vitro fertilization, may have lower sperm concentration and more fertility struggles compared to men conceived naturally. The study focused on 54 men conceived through ICSI and found that they had lower average sperm concentration, total sperm count, and total motile sperm count. The researchers suggest that couples should be informed about this potential outcome before undergoing ICSI. However, the study also found that a low sperm concentration in fathers did not necessarily match the values found in their sons. Therefore, some men conceived through ICSI may still be able to father children naturally. It is recommended for them to start trying to conceive at a younger age, as fertility declines with age.

The mother has been charged with murder and child abuse. The family lived in a one-bedroom house, with the boy kept hidden in closets and sedated with sleep medications. The other children in the family were aware of the situation but concealed it from their stepfather. The stepfather was devastated upon learning the truth and called the police. A public memorial was held for the boy, and the stepfather vowed to continue telling his story to prevent similar cases from happening again.

"At least 26 Afghan civilians were killed and many others injured in airstrikes in Kunduz province, Afghanistan, while NATO and Afghan forces were fighting Taliban fighters. Two American service members also died in ground clashes. Conflicting reports on the number of casualties and no official account of the airstrikes have been provided. Some local officials claim that up to 100 civilians were killed or wounded. The incident is reminiscent of the tragic events in Kunduz last year when a U.S. airstrike mistakenly targeted a hospital, killing 42 patients and staff members. NATO officials have not confirmed the reported deaths of the civilians. Angry relatives of the victims attempted to protest, but were stopped by security forces. U.S. military officials confirmed the deaths of the two American service members and stated their commitment to helping Afghan partners defend their nation.

It would be devastating for a young person to suffer an eye injury simply playing a sport. People should be extremely vigilant to prepare children to play such sports and avoid suffering any life altering injuries.	Eye injuries in youth sports are common and often involve activities that are not typically considered risky for eyes, according to a study of emergency room visits related to eye problems among athletes. The study found that about 30,000 sports-related eye injuries were treated each year at participating emergency rooms, with a majority occurring in people younger than 18. Basketball was the sport most likely to result in eye injuries, followed by baseball, softball, air guns, cycling, and soccer. While most injuries were minor, some required surgery and threatened athletes' vision. The study suggests that protective eyewear, such as wraparound glasses, could help prevent these injuries.

Sleep paralysis is a common sleep problem that affects around 8% of the population. It occurs when a person is awake and conscious but unable to move, except for their eyes. Sleep paralysis often involves nightmares or hallucinations and can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The causes of sleep paralysis are not fully understood, but stress and disruptions to sleep, such as alcohol or caffeine, can increase the risk. It can also be a symptom of other sleep disorders and mental health conditions. Kendall Jenner discussed her struggles with sleep paralysis, which may be linked to her anxiety and jet lag. Sleep paralysis is more common in people with mental health problems and young adults. For most people, it is not a chronic condition, but some individuals experience recurrent episodes. Practicing good sleep behaviors, such as avoiding alcohol and caffeine and sleeping on your side, can help prevent sleep paralysis. If it becomes a problem, a specialist may be able to prescribe medications to suppress REM sleep and alleviate symptoms.

Police in Hope, Indiana, shared a disturbing photo of a mother passed out in her car from a drug overdose, with her 10-month-old son crying in the backseat. The incident highlights a growing trend of parents using drugs with their children in the car to avoid disapproval. The mother was revived with Narcan and charged with child neglect and possession of drug paraphernalia. The child now lives with his grandmother. This case is similar to a previous incident in East Liverpool, Ohio, where a couple overdosed with their 4-year-old son in the car. The police hope that sharing these photos will discourage drug users from endangering children. The opioid crisis continues to claim the lives of about 78 Americans every day.

Advocates for the West has filed a lawsuit on behalf of Western Watersheds Project to challenge the Forest Service's grazing decisions in the White Clouds Wilderness and East Fork Salmon River. The Forest Service has allowed heavy grazing and repeated violations on these public lands, despite acknowledging in 2003 that grazing was causing significant harm to resources. The lawsuit aims to protect the sensitive habitat for various fish species and improve management of the watershed. The grazing has also impacted recreational opportunities in the area. The groups are urging the Forest Service to take action and prioritize the preservation of these lands.

On one side are public health advocates who believe that vaccines can make a significant impact in preventing and treating cholera. On the other side are public health officials who argue that vaccines are not effective enough and that the focus should be on improving water and sanitation infrastructure. The World Health Organization (WHO) has tried to support both approaches but has not settled on how to fund them. Cholera is a deadly disease caused by contaminated water, and it kills about 100,000 people worldwide each year. Two oral vaccines exist, but they have limitations and do not address the underlying causes of cholera. The debate over vaccines has caused division and hindered progress in the fight against cholera. The text also mentions the history of cholera and the breakthroughs in understanding and treating the disease. It highlights the devastating cholera outbreak in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and the missed opportunity to distribute vaccines. The text concludes by mentioning new ideas and approaches, such as using mobile phones to report cholera cases and promoting water sterilization tablets.

Microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by malformed heads and stunted brain development, has been linked to the Zika virus. The severity of microcephaly can vary, but it often results in mental impairment. Detecting the condition before birth is difficult, leading to debates about abortion. Raising a child with microcephaly requires extensive care and support, which can be costly. Early intervention programs can help, but they often end after three years. The CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics have published guidelines for evaluating and caring for infants with Zika-related microcephaly. The cost of care for each child is estimated to be $10 million over a lifetime. Families with resources, like the Grounds family, can provide the best care for their child, but many others struggle. Nicholas, a child with microcephaly, has made progress with intensive intervention, but ongoing support is necessary. Parents of children with microcephaly need support throughout their lives. Genetic testing revealed that Nicholas inherited two mutated genes from his parents, causing microcephaly. The odds of their second child having the condition were one in four.

"An Oregon man died in Yellowstone National Park after falling into a boiling, acidic spring while attempting to ""hot pot"" or soak in one of the park's thermal pools. The victim's sister witnessed the incident and reported it to park officials. The brother and sister had illegally ventured off the boardwalk at Norris Geyser Basin. Rescuers were unable to retrieve the body initially, and it was later determined that the extreme heat and acidity of the water had dissolved it. The park prohibits walking off the boardwalks or swimming in hot springs, but no citations have been issued in this case."

"A new report by environmental group Amazon Watch reveals that the United States is driving the destruction of the Amazon rainforest by importing crude oil from the region. American refineries processed over 230,000 barrels of Amazon crude oil per day last year, with California alone refining an average of 170,978 barrels per day. The expansion of oil drilling in the Amazon poses a serious threat to the region, with proposed oil and gas fields covering an area larger than Texas. The destruction of the Amazon rainforest releases greenhouse gases and puts indigenous communities and biodiversity at risk. Ecuador's state oil company recently started drilling near the biologically rich Yasuni national park. Indigenous communities are at risk of pollution, displacement, and deadly illnesses. Amazon Watch is calling for a reduction in Amazon crude imports and the establishment of ""no go zones"" in decision making."

The British Government is supporting an oil drilling project in Uganda's Murchison Falls National Park, which poses a significant risk to the endangered Rothschild giraffe species. The project involves drilling multiple wells in the park, which is home to one of the last remaining populations of these giraffes. Leaked documents reveal that the British oil company, Tullow Oil, has been in talks with the government to provide taxpayer-backed loans and insurance for the project. Conservationists have been relocating giraffes away from the drilling sites to protect them. Greenpeace UK criticizes the government's support for the project and urges them to focus on sustainable energy sources instead. Tullow Oil claims to have committed to protecting the Rothschild giraffe during the development.

The Cavendish banana, which is the most widely sold banana in the Western world, is facing the threat of extinction due to its vulnerability to diseases. The previous popular variety, Gros Michel, was wiped out by a fungal disease called Fusarium wilt. The Cavendish replaced it but is now susceptible to a disease called Black Sigatoka. Additionally, a new strain of Fusarium wilt called Tropical Race 4 (TR4) is spreading and could devastate the banana industry. To combat these diseases, scientists are studying the genetics of wild banana varieties and banana pathogens to find resistant genes. However, there has been little effort and funding for this research. By increasing genetic diversity in cultivated bananas, the industry can reduce its vulnerability to diseases. Scientists have already identified the genome sequences of bananas and the fungi causing the diseases, which provides a basis for identifying disease-resistant genes. With the use of genetic engineering and plant breeding, these genes can be transferred into desired cultivars. It is crucial to increase the pool of genetic diversity in cultivated bananas to avoid repeating the history of the Gros Michel and Cavendish varieties.

A month after Hurricane Matthew hit southwestern Haiti, the region is facing widespread hunger and destruction. At least 800,000 people urgently need food, but there is not enough aid reaching the affected areas. Truckloads of food and medical supplies have been looted, and desperate crowds have clashed with police. The storm destroyed homes, crops, and livestock, leaving many without shelter or a means to survive. Cholera outbreaks are also occurring due to contaminated water supplies. The United Nations has only raised one-third of the emergency funding needed to help the affected population. The Haitian government, along with international relief organizations, is coordinating efforts to provide assistance, but political obstacles and the upcoming elections pose challenges. The situation is dire, with people sleeping under trees and lacking basic necessities. The destruction is so severe that some remote mountain villages may not receive aid until the end of November.

Nosey, a 34-year-old female African elephant, has been held captive and subjected to decades of abuse. She has been forced to live in solitary confinement, perform in circuses, and give rides to people. This has caused significant stress to her physical and psychological well-being. Nosey has spent most of her life in a small trailer, receiving little exercise and no socialization. She has developed arthritis due to her long-term confinement. Despite over 200 citations and 30 violations of the Animal Welfare Act by her owner, Hugo Tommy Liebel, the USDA has not taken action. Nosey is suffering from chronic, untreated health problems and lives in pain. The USDA has the power and responsibility to respond to citizen complaints and confiscate Nosey, releasing her into a proper elephant sanctuary. Immediate action is needed to end the daily abuse of this animal.

The story is about a white person in his 50's if I am not mistaking that was bothered by the loud music that was playing in a Durango by some black teenagers at a gas station in Florida. There was an argument regarding the music and some exchange of words. The white guy shot the 17 year old black kid 6 times. He was convicted for life with the possibility of parole after 2 years. He was denied. These situations are complicated and they are happening quite often lately. There should be a limit on many things, and one of them should be the guns. There should be a stricter gun control .	"An appeals court in Florida has upheld the murder conviction of Michael Dunn, a white man who fatally shot a black teenager during an argument over loud rap music. Dunn was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2014 for the shooting of Jordan Davis. Dunn's lawyers argued that he acted in self-defense, but the court denied their claim. The case drew national attention and sparked debate over Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" law and racial issues. Davis' family expressed relief at the court's decision, but acknowledged that their fight for justice and changes in gun laws continues."

"Sally Brampton, the founding editor of Elle magazine in the UK, took her own life after health professionals failed to offer her help, according to an inquest. Brampton, who had a long battle with depression, drowned after walking into the sea near her home. She had sought help from a psychiatrist and GP but did not receive the assistance she needed. Two months prior to her death, she had been referred to mental health services but was not offered any help. The inquest revealed that crucial information about her condition had not been provided to the relevant services. The coroner concluded that there were missed opportunities to help Brampton, but it is uncertain if they would have changed the outcome. The mental health services have since made changes and no longer use faxes. Brampton was a respected journalist and author, known for her book ""Shoot the Damn Dog"" about her battle with depression."
379	6.2	4.875	I just read on a news paper about a situation in the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka about their water situations. They are confronted with a very complicated water problem that is quickly turning extremely serious. The capital city has a population of 15 million. They are pumping the water from the city from the underground and the water is dropping with 9 feet every year. My understanding is that the water is becoming less potable as the pumping is going deeper being contaminated with arsenic. The researchers are trying to locate the contaminated areas and in the meantime thinking of different sources of water such as the one with the help of monsoon. They do have serious problems over there and sounds pretty difficult to have it fixed.

Many will have to suffer unfortunately in the meantime	Overpumping of groundwater in Dhaka, Bangladesh is causing a water crisis that extends beyond the city center. The pumping has caused groundwater levels to drop significantly over the past 50 years, leading to water quality and supply issues in surrounding peri-urban and rural communities. The presence of naturally occurring arsenic in shallow groundwater further exacerbates the problem. The pumping is causing faster groundwater flow, which can transport contaminants like arsenic to deeper areas of the aquifer, even outside the city limits. This poses a threat to deep wells used for arsenic mitigation in these areas. The researchers used detailed subsurface measurements to model the geology of Dhaka and found that strong pumping and heterogeneity in the underground sediments affect the hydrology of the area. Heterogeneity refers to the way sand and clay are oriented underground and is critical to how contaminants move in groundwater. In a delta system like Bangladesh, the clay layers are chopped up, allowing water to move in unpredictable ways and creating uncertainty about well contamination. The researchers theorize that if pumping continues at current levels, some wells outside the city center could become contaminated sooner than expected. The low water levels caused by pumping could also compromise the operation of handpumps in these areas. Arsenic is tasteless, odorless, and colorless, making it difficult for communities to detect its presence in water without testing. The researchers' models showed that typical hydrogeological data used to assess well safety is not predictive in this type of heterogeneous system. This highlights the need for water quality monitoring and the development of artificial groundwater recharge methods to address the water crisis in the region.

His cattle have become semi-feral and roam over a large area near the Nevada, Utah, Arizona border. Bundy does not vaccinate or treat his cattle for disease, does not control breeding, and rarely brands them. The cattle are now reported to be slowly starving, although there is no official confirmation. The State of Nevada has not taken action to round up the cattle due to logistical difficulties and threats from Bundy supporters. Removing the cattle will be expensive and potentially dangerous, as they are near feral and aggressive. The value of the herd will also decline in the hot Nevada summer.

Toughie, the last Rabbs' fringe-limbed tree frog, has died, marking the extinction of his species. The frog, featured in the Photo Ark project, served as a symbol of the extinction crisis. Toughie's species was only described in 2008, three years after he was found during a frog rescue mission. The deadly chytrid fungus wiped out up to 85% of amphibians in Toughie's habitat. Photographer Joel Sartore, who photographed Toughie for the Photo Ark project, emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about extinction. He believes that people need to meet and fall in love with these animals to care about their preservation. The loss of species threatens healthy ecosystems and ultimately our own survival. Sartore warns that if we continue on this path, we could lose half of all species by the end of the century.

Islamic State fighters launched a series of car bomb attacks in northern Syria as U.S.-backed forces began their push to retake Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State. The operation aims to isolate Raqqa and cut off supply routes for the militants. The car bomb attacks were a preview of the fierce battle that lies ahead. The U.S.-led coalition conducted airstrikes in support of the offensive. However, the U.S. also sought to calm Turkey, which is concerned about the increased influence of Kurdish groups in the region. The Obama administration faces the challenge of balancing its relationship with Turkey and the Syrian Kurdish forces it supports. Talks were held to secure Turkish support for the operation and to reassure Ankara that the offensive would not benefit Syrian Kurds.

They are accepting the possibility of a Hillary Clinton victory and a Democratic majority in the Senate. This has led to discussions about how Republicans should proceed after the election. They must decide whether to cooperate with Democrats and try to get things done, or to adopt a noncooperative strategy in hopes of regaining control in the 2018 midterm elections. There are also questions about the future of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the Supreme Court nominee. Republicans fear that Clinton will be influenced by progressive forces and that compromises will be difficult to achieve. They also worry about the dissatisfaction among their voters and the potential backlash if they work with Democrats. However, some Republicans argue that waiting until 2018 may be a better strategy. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer believes there is a moral imperative to get government working again and hopes to work with Republicans. Hillary Clinton is seen as someone capable of building relationships with Republican leaders. Overall, if Democrats win the White House and Senate, considerable effort will be needed to bring a new spirit to a gridlocked Congress.

"The Trump campaign has been pursuing a strategy of publicly courting black voters while privately seeking to depress their turnout, according to a BusinessWeek article. The campaign has three major voter suppression operations targeting idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. These operations include placing negative ads on select African American radio stations and using Facebook ""dark posts"" to deliver targeted messages. The campaign believes that depressing Clinton's vote total among these groups will benefit Trump. However, there is evidence that negative campaigning does not significantly depress voter turnout. Trump's approach to African Americans has been seen as insincere, with many of his events aimed at them taking place in predominantly white areas. As a result, Trump's polling among African Americans is poor, with him trailing Clinton by a large margin. While Trump's advisors believe that he doesn't need black votes to win, future Republican candidates will, and the campaign's efforts to suppress black voter turnout may harm the party's relationship with this demographic for years to come."

I am terribly worried, not only for the children of Flint, but for All the children who are still drinking water with high lead levels.	A new report by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) reveals that over 18 million Americans are supplied with drinking water that violates federal laws on lead content. The report states that the water crisis in Flint, Michigan is not an isolated incident, and that violations of national rules protecting against lead contamination are widespread. The NRDC's analysis of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows that 5,363 water systems, serving more than 18 million people, breached the federal Lead and Copper Rule in 2015. These violations include inadequate testing for lead and insufficient treatment to prevent lead from leaching into the water supply. The violations occurred in almost every state, with 1,110 community water utilities providing water that exceeded the EPA's actionable limit for lead. Despite the widespread failure of water suppliers, very few were punished by the EPA last year. Of the over 8,000 violations, enforcement action was only taken against 11% of cases, and penalties were sought for just 3% of violations. The EPA has acknowledged the challenges in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule and has intensified work with state drinking water programs. However, a revised rule will not be implemented until 2017 at the earliest. The NRDC emphasizes that unsafe drinking water is a national problem that requires a national solution. The failure of the system to detect violations is highlighted by the fact that Flint was not considered in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule last year, despite the well-known water crisis. The CDC has reported that lead levels in the blood of Flint children significantly increased after the city switched its water supply. The NRDC also revealed that water utilities often manipulate test results to downplay lead levels. The Guardian has reported that at least 33 US cities have used methods to mask the true level of lead in water tests. The report raises concerns about the extent of the issue and calls for a coordinated effort at all levels to prevent future crises.

The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has called for large-scale, long-term investment in Somalia to ensure the successful repatriation of Somali refugees from the Dadaab camp in Kenya. The Kenyan government plans to close the camp by November 30th and has accepted a request to extend the deadline by six months. However, the IRC warns that deferring the closure will not address the refugees' concerns about violence, displacement, and gender-based violence in Somalia. The IRC emphasizes the need for support and integration programs for refugees, as well as investment in Somalia to provide earning opportunities. Since the announcement of the camp's closure, the rate of refugee movement from Kenya to Somalia has increased four-fold.

His family is the one that suffers unfortunately.	A young boy who was trapped in a narrow well in China for four days has been found dead. The boy fell into the well while helping his father harvest vegetables. Despite efforts from over 500 responders, the well was too narrow for adults to enter, so excavators were used to dig it out. The boy's body was discovered on Thursday.

A mass grave containing the bodies of hundreds of Iraqi policemen who were executed by ISIS has been discovered near Mosul. The grave was found by Iraqi security forces during their assault on the ISIS stronghold. The bodies are believed to have been buried as recently as October, just before the US-backed forces began their assault on Mosul. The grave was visited by Human Rights Watch, who found four exposed corpses and piles of rubbish covering other bodies. Witnesses reported that ISIS rounded up around 2,000 people from the area and forced them to head towards Mosul, separating the former policemen and driving them away. Gunfire and screams were heard on multiple occasions, indicating further executions. Human Rights Watch has called for ISIS to be held accountable for these crimes against humanity.

India's unregulated coal industry has resulted in serious health and environmental issues. The mining has caused respiratory problems and illnesses like tuberculosis among people, while forests are being cleared for coal mining, leading to conflicts between wild elephants and humans. Elephants have caused significant property and crop damage, and deaths due to electrocution have become common. The affected communities have not received adequate compensation or support. Additionally, the generation of fly ash by power plants is causing pollution and leaching into groundwater. Lung diseases such as tuberculosis are prevalent in villages near open cast mines.

Also important is the situation in Gaza, and other conflict zones, makes it rather difficult to maintain a humanely run zoo, and have veterinarians on hand in case the animals become ill.	"An animal-welfare organization called Four Paws recently rescued the remaining animals from a zoo near the Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis. The zoo, known as the ""world's worst zoo,"" had a history of neglect and animal deaths, including taxidermy of dead animals. The rescue mission was complicated due to the ongoing conflict in the region, but the team successfully evacuated the animals and transferred them to sanctuaries. The rescue has been hailed as a milestone in animal rights, but concerns remain about the wider issues of wildlife trafficking and the commercialization of wild animals in Gaza. The rescued animals will now receive care and rehabilitation in their new homes. There are hopes to create new legislation in Gaza to address these issues and prevent animal smuggling. The organization is also concerned about other zoos in conflict zones that require immediate attention."

"A female lawyer has accused Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of groping her in 1999. Moira Smith, who was 23 at the time, claims that Thomas grabbed her without her consent during a Truman Foundation dinner. Smith described the incident on Facebook before deactivating her page. She stated that Thomas ""cupped his hand around my butt and pulled me pretty close to him"" and later ""squeezed"" her behind. Smith's former roommates and fellow Truman scholars confirmed that she had described the incident at the time. Thomas has denied the allegations. This comes years after Thomas' confirmation hearings were marred by accusations of sexual harassment from Anita Hill. Hill recently wrote an op-ed about her experience, emphasizing the importance of believing women who come forward with allegations of sexual harassment or violence."

The camp is in a state of hardship, with most inhabitants gone and those remaining facing constant tension and the threat of fire and bulldozers. The French authorities promised to accommodate all refugees but failed to do so, leaving many homeless. Despite detailed census information, the authorities ignored estimates and abandoned almost 2,000 refugees. Help Refugees warned that housing minors in shipping containers would expose them to danger, and now there are approximately 1,500 children subjected to these conditions. The children report lack of basic necessities such as drinking water, clean toilets, and working showers, and are only provided with one meal a day. The authorities have shown little regard for their wellbeing and have failed to safeguard them. Arbitrary security measures and restrictions on volunteers further isolate the children and cut off their access to communication and legal assistance. Many refugees are sleeping outside in the cold and rain, exposed to danger. Despite the desperate conditions, volunteers continue to provide support. Charities received notice that children in the container camp will be transferred to accommodation centers across France, but there are no guarantees and the process may take time. It is crucial for charities to ensure that refugees in France receive better care.

A Muslim woman wearing traditional garments had her clothes set on fire by a man with a lighter while shopping on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The woman noticed her blouse was on fire and saw a man with a lighter in his hand before he walked away.

Over 14,000 Saudi women have signed a petition calling for an end to the country's male guardianship system, which requires women to have the consent of a male guardian for various activities. The campaign gained support online through a trending Twitter hashtag. Women in Saudi Arabia must obtain permission from a male relative for activities such as traveling, working, studying, and even leaving the country. The petition was delivered to the government, and the activists are awaiting a response. The male guardianship system also affects women's ability to rent a flat, seek medical treatment, or file a legal claim. The campaign has received an incredible response, with hundreds of women bombarding the Saudi King's office with telegrams supporting the cause. However, there is opposition from some Saudi women who argue for reforming the system. The activists are demanding that women be treated as full citizens and that an age between 18 and 21 be designated as the point at which a woman is considered an adult. There has been no official response to the petition yet.

At least 800,000 people urgently need food, but there is not enough aid reaching the affected areas. Truckloads of food and medical supplies have been looted, and desperate crowds have clashed with police. The storm destroyed homes, crops, and livestock, leaving many without shelter or a means to survive. Cholera outbreaks are also occurring due to contaminated water supplies. The United Nations has only raised one-third of the emergency funding needed to help the affected population. The Haitian government, along with international relief organizations, is coordinating efforts to provide assistance, but political obstacles and the upcoming elections pose challenges. The situation is dire, with people sleeping under trees and lacking basic necessities. The destruction is so severe that some remote mountain villages may not receive aid until the end of November.

Officer Betty Jo Shelby claimed she feared for her life when Terence Crutcher, the driver, did not respond to her commands and walked away with his hands up. Prosecutors have charged her with committing manslaughter ""in the heat of passion."" The shooting has sparked outrage and is part of a larger pattern of police killings of black individuals. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave and a separate investigation is being conducted to determine if Crutcher's civil rights were violated."

While the virus has infected over 650,000 people in the region, the majority of babies born with congenital neurological damage linked to Zika have been clustered in northeastern Brazil. Health officials and scientists are investigating other factors that may be contributing to the higher toll in this region, such as the presence of other mosquito-borne viruses or environmental and genetic factors. The number of cases of birth defects linked to Zika outside of Brazil has been relatively low, leading researchers to caution that it will take years to fully understand the dangers the virus poses to babies' brains. The outbreak in Puerto Rico is being closely monitored, but the mainland United States has so far averted a major outbreak. The lack of funding for Zika research and prevention has hindered efforts to accurately count the number of people infected and assess the true impact of the virus.

The article was extremely hard to read and understand, especially with it being written in one giant block, so those are really the only key points I got from it.	Aging bonobos have been found to develop farsightedness, similar to humans. Instead of using glasses, they adjust their position when grooming to compensate for their deteriorating eyesight. Researchers observed that older bonobos sat back and extended their arms farther than younger bonobos, and this behavior increased over time. This shift in position is believed to be an adaptation to their declining vision. The study compared grooming distances of 14 wild bonobos between the ages of 11 and 45. The findings could provide insights into human aging and the impact of evolutionary heritage on age-related deterioration.

The increase of the planet's temperature is adversely affecting coffee growth in areas where the plants have always thrived. Funny (not really at all funny), but more people will worry about their brand of coffee going extinct than about animal and plant species being constantly wiped out for good.	A report commissioned by Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand warns that climate change poses a significant threat to the world's coffee supply. The report highlights the impact of warming temperatures on farmland, which will reduce the global area suitable for coffee by about 50%. It also emphasizes the increased risk of diseases and pests, such as coffee rust and the coffee berry borer. Major coffee companies have been aware of these threats for years and have been implementing support programs for coffee growers. However, the report suggests that no single company is large enough to tackle the challenge of climate change on its own. The World Coffee Research group is developing adaptive strategies to address the issue, including preserving genetic diversity, creating a variety catalog, and evaluating new coffee varieties. Despite these efforts, there are still major gaps in knowledge on how to best help coffee producers adapt to climate change. The report raises concerns about the livelihoods of the 125 million people worldwide who depend on coffee, particularly those in developing countries. Urgent action is needed to prevent devastating consequences for these communities.

The demand for rhino horns, which are used in traditional medicine and high-end ornaments, has led to a spike in poaching. The South African government has declared rhino poaching a ""national priority crime"" and has implemented initiatives to combat the problem. Private rhino owners have spent millions of dollars on security measures, but the fight against poaching remains challenging. The security industry plays a crucial role in protecting rhinos on private game reserves, but there are concerns about the escalating conflict and the potential for violence. Some believe that more focus should be placed on education and awareness to address the root causes of poaching."

Residents in war-ravaged eastern Aleppo received a text message warning them to evacuate within 24 hours before a planned assault. The message, likely sent by the Syrian government, also gave rebels an ultimatum to surrender or be killed. While there were no reports of bombardment by Monday afternoon, witnesses spotted fighter jets in the city. Russian warplanes have been backing the regime with airstrikes since September, causing destruction in Aleppo. The UN warned that the city is on the brink of starvation and lacks essential supplies. Turkey has been carrying out airstrikes in northern Syria to support the Free Syrian Army and plans to move on to Manbij after liberating al-Bab from ISIS. This move has stirred sectarian tensions and complicated efforts to free Syrian cities from ISIS control. Turkey considers some Kurdish militia groups as terrorists, while the US supports and arms them. The conflict between the US and Russia over which groups to target in Syria further complicates the situation.

"A 5.0 magnitude earthquake struck Cushing, Oklahoma, causing substantial damage to dozens of buildings. However, no damage was reported at the oil terminal, which is one of the world's largest. This was the third earthquake in Oklahoma this year with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater. No major injuries were reported, but there were cracks, fallen bricks, and facades damaged. The earthquake was centered 1 mile west of Cushing and occurred near a previous magnitude 4.3 quake. Aftershocks were feared, and parts of the city were cordoned off. An assisted living community was evacuated, and the Cushing Public School District canceled classes. Highways and bridges within a 15-mile radius of the epicenter were undamaged. The quake was felt as far away as Iowa, Illinois, and Texas. Cushing is known as the ""Pipeline Crossroads of the World"" and has a large oil storage terminal. Two pipeline companies reported no trouble, but not all companies had been heard from."

Worst of all, they are killing Golden Eagles, an endangered species! It's just really sad."	Wind turbines are not only killing local birds, but also birds from hundreds of miles away, according to researchers from Purdue University and the U.S. Geological Survey. Using DNA and stable isotopes, the researchers found that golden eagles killed at a wind farm in California can come from far distances. This raises concerns about the impact of wind farms on bird populations. The Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) in California, one of the oldest and largest wind farms in the world, has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of birds. The researchers found that eagles are attracted to the area due to the abundance of prey and the windy conditions, but fail to see the turbine blades and get hit. The study also revealed that a large percentage of the birds killed are from neighboring states, highlighting the need for environmental assessments to consider the impact on the entire population. The findings have implications for the management of wind energy facilities and the conservation of bird species.

The incident occurred as residents gathered around to buy fuel from the driver. Charred bodies were found at the blast site, and more bodies may be in the surrounding woods. Some badly burned individuals attempted to escape into a nearby river. The truck driver from Malawi had turned off the main road to sell fuel to locals when the fire broke out. Medical teams and searchers were dispatched to the scene, but their efforts were hindered by darkness. The cause of the explosion is still unknown, with theories suggesting a fire near the tanker or a lightning strike. A government task force is set to visit the site.

The terror group carried out mass killings as punishment for defying its orders. Since October 17, ISIS has taken tens of thousands of men, women, and children from the outskirts of Mosul into the city, intending to use them as human shields. Iraqi forces have launched an operation to cut ISIS supply lines west of Mosul. Reports indicate that ISIS has abducted thousands of families from various areas. The use of human shields is a violation of international humanitarian law. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned ISIS's strategy and urged those fighting ISIS not to carry out revenge attacks. The Mosul operation has already displaced thousands of people, and camps have been set up to accommodate them. Civilians continue to flee despite the risks involved.

The operation targeted Taliban leaders planning attacks in the city. Alongside the 30 civilians, two US service members were also killed. The US military expressed regret for the loss of innocent lives and promised to investigate the incident. Afghan forces, with US military advice, conducted the operation and encountered significant enemy fire. In addition to the civilian casualties, four members of Afghan special forces were killed, and 26 insurgents were killed. The Pentagon identified the dead US service members and expressed condolences. The incident occurred on the same day as a Taliban mortar attack that killed seven people attending a wedding party. In April, the Pentagon announced disciplinary action for a fatal US strike on a Kunduz hospital in 2015. The strike was deemed unintentional human error and equipment failure, rather than a war crime.

Adam Crapser, a South Korean man who was adopted by an American couple when he was 3 years old, is being deported back to South Korea. Crapser has spent 37 of his 41 years in the United States and has a family there. However, he is being held in an immigration detention center and will be deported as soon as the necessary arrangements are made. Crapser's life in the United States has been difficult, including being abandoned by his adoptive parents and experiencing abuse in subsequent foster homes. He has also had a criminal record, which makes him eligible for deportation. The deportation is a result of his adoptive parents and the adoption agency failing to register him for U.S. citizenship. Many intercountry adoptees face this issue, and Congress is currently considering a bill that would grant citizenship to all children adopted by U.S. citizens. Crapser hopes that the bill will pass, but it will be too late for him. The Adoptee Rights Campaign and others find his deportation appalling and are urging the community to call members of Congress to support a legislative fix.

This will drastically change our weather and therefore cause disastrous effects to many, many places around the world.  This can all be stopped though if we get on board now!	President-Elect Donald J. Trump's policies could have catastrophic effects on the planet's climate. By withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and terminating President Obama's Clean Power Plan, Trump could push global temperatures to rise higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius, leading to devastating consequences such as extreme weather patterns and mass extinctions. While other countries are committed to their climate commitments, Trump's actions could encourage them to abandon their commitments and emit more greenhouse gases. Trump's denial of climate change and his intention to cut off American support for UN climate science further exacerbate the situation. However, climate activists and environmental leaders are determined to continue their efforts at the local and state levels, pushing for emissions-restriction plans and the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure. Despite the divisions between Democrats and Republicans on climate policy, there is bipartisan support for investments in clean energy and climate resilience. The construction of wind and solar power plants could not only address climate change but also boost U.S. manufacturing and reduce electricity costs. The willingness of Trump and Republican leaders to support such initiatives remains uncertain.

His body was found six days after he set off alone for the climb. His girlfriend, Bluebell Baughan, had pleaded with him to get help after he got lost on the mountain. Webb slipped, injured himself, and got lost off the main trail due to a landslide. He refused Baughan's pleas to call for help and had to spend the night dressed only in shorts. In his last text, he asked Baughan to raise the alarm, but the message failed to get through. His body was eventually found in a stream, and local police concluded that he had drowned while unconscious. The cause of his death could not be ascertained due to embalming. Webb's parents described him as a joy to be around and expressed their close bond as a family.

A new study suggesting that Earth could be doomed to warming of up to 13 degrees Fahrenheit is being dismissed as flawed by climate scientists. The study, published in Nature, offers a reconstruction of global sea-surface temperatures for the past two million years. However, several top scientists argue that the author's conclusions about catastrophic temperature rise are not supported by the data. They claim that the study's author made a fundamental mistake in her analysis. Other scientists also criticize the study for extrapolating from past ice ages to the present climate. NASA's chief climate scientist states that if greenhouse gas levels stay the same, temperatures may rise an additional 0.5 to 1 degree Celsius, not 7 degrees. The study's author defends her work, stating that it shows a close relationship between temperature and greenhouse gases. However, critics argue that her method is not the way to determine the Earth's sensitivity to CO2. The question of how sensitive Earth's climate will be to CO2 emissions remains open. In a separate article, a congressional committee reveals that sexual harassment and bullying among National Park Service employees at iconic parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone has been pervasive and ongoing for years. Whistleblowers detailed several alleged offenses, including stalking and inappropriate behavior by supervisors. The Park Service has vowed to end harassment and is working to change its culture.

Middle school was a miserable time for me as I struggled with some classes and often felt either depressed or angry for no particular reason.  I remember feeling constantly stressed over both academics and the challenges of middle school social life with maintaining friendships, cliques, dating etc.	A new study by Arizona State University researchers found that middle school is the most stressful time for mothers. The study involved analyzing surveys from over 2,200 well-educated moms across the country, and mothers of only middle-school-age children reported the highest levels of stress, loneliness, and emptiness. Middle school is a challenging time for children, with raging hormones, changing bodies and brains, exposure to peer pressure and risky behaviors, and a desire for independence while still feeling dependent on parents. Parents often struggle to navigate these changes and may not realize that their children still want a relationship with them. It is important for parents to listen, be supportive, and not give up during this time. Developing a strong relationship during middle school can carry into the teen years and young adulthood. Mothers should also reach out to other moms for support during this challenging time.

The mental health care provided to detainees at Guantánamo Bay has been compromised by a lack of training, ethical boundaries, and information about their treatment during interrogations. Psychiatrists and psychologists were often unaware of the abuse that had taken place, and were discouraged from asking detainees about their experiences. The quality of care has been criticized by human rights groups and defense teams, who argue that it has been negligent and ineffective. Many detainees suffer from psychological problems as a result of their treatment, but PTSD is rarely diagnosed due to the impracticality of treatment in the prison environment. The mental health personnel faced numerous challenges, including distrust from detainees and the blurred lines between medical care and interrogation. Despite these obstacles, they did their best to provide care to the prisoners.

A security crackdown in northern Rakhine state, Burma, following militant attacks has worsened the humanitarian situation and drawn international attention to Aung San Suu Kyi's government. The government has accused the Rohingya Muslim community of being behind the attacks, leading to a manhunt and reports of abuse by the military. The United Nations and the US have called for investigations into the alleged abuse and the restoration of humanitarian access. Human Rights Watch has reported burned villages and alleged rape of Muslim women by soldiers. The crisis is seen as a major test for Suu Kyi's new government, which is accused of not doing enough to address the Rohingya crisis. The Rohingya, who are essentially stateless, are considered illegal immigrants by many in the Buddhist-majority country. The security crackdown has displaced thousands of people and disrupted access to healthcare and food assistance. Suu Kyi has called for strengthening border security, following the rule of law, and creating a development plan for the area. However, the Rohingya community does not believe there is a militant group operating in the state and accuses the government of deliberate assassination. The crisis has further eroded confidence in Suu Kyi's government among the affected population.

Insha Mushtaq, a 14-year-old girl from Indian-administered Kashmir, lost her vision in both eyes after being hit by pellets. She has been in and out of hospitals for the past three months in an attempt to regain her vision, but nothing has worked so far. Insha remains hopeful and still dreams of becoming a doctor. The ongoing unrest in Kashmir has resulted in the deaths of 89 civilians and thousands of injuries. Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir, and the region has been a source of conflict for over 60 years. Pellet guns, originally used as a non-lethal weapon in 2010, have caused over a thousand eye injuries in recent months. Insha's family is struggling to cope with her injuries, and she tries to stay positive despite the challenges ahead.

"Sharbat Gula, the Afghan woman known for her striking green eyes in a National Geographic cover photo, has been arrested in Pakistan for falsifying documents and staying illegally in the country. If convicted, she could face up to 14 years in jail or deportation. Last year, Gula was arrested on similar charges but was later released. Photographer Steve McCurry, who took the iconic photo, has expressed his objection to her arrest and is committed to helping her legally and financially. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) stated that they can only assist Gula if she registers as a refugee, but she falls under the category of ""undocumented migrants."" The arrest highlights the mounting pressure on Afghan refugees in Pakistan to return home, with over 370,000 Afghans being repatriated since July 1. Human Rights Watch has raised concerns about the situation, stating that millions of Afghans have sought shelter in Pakistan due to conflict and poverty in their own country."

Over 1,800 public primary schools in Delhi will close to protect children from dangerous levels of air pollution. The decision affects more than a million children. The smog is a result of burning crops, fireworks, dust, and vehicle emissions. The most dangerous particles, PM 2.5, reached 600 micrograms per cubic meter. Sustained exposure to this concentration is equivalent to smoking 40 cigarettes a day and increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, asthma, and pneumonia. The pollution has caused visible effects on children, including coughing and difficulty breathing. Foreigners and elites have expressed concern about winter air pollution, and some embassies discourage families with children from moving to Delhi. Parents have reported symptoms such as burning eyes and congestion in their children. The city has taken these measures for the first time, and they hope weather conditions will improve soon. Keeping children at home reduces their exposure to air pollution, but indoor air quality is often not much better unless doors and windows are closed and sealed.

Many patients avoid colonoscopies due to the unpleasant preparation process, which involves drinking a salty, repulsive-tasting drink and laxative. However, a Boston-based company called ColonaryConcepts is developing bowel-clearing food bars and drinks that taste more like fruit smoothies and chocolate. These products have been tested in a phase 2 trial and have shown promising results in terms of effectiveness and patient satisfaction. The new colonoscopy prep is scheduled to begin phase 3 trials next year and could potentially enter the market in 2018. This alternative option aims to improve the tolerability and cleansing effect of the preparation process. It is important for patients to not put off colonoscopies, as they are crucial for detecting and preventing colon cancer.

Consumer Reports has released a report identifying fifteen supplement ingredients that can cause illness or even death. The risks associated with these ingredients include cancer, organ damage, and cardiac arrest. The severity of the threats depends on factors such as pre-existing conditions, the quantity of ingredients taken, and the length of exposure. The report lists the dangerous ingredients, including aconite, caffeine powder, chaparral, coltsfoot, comfrey, germander, greater celandine, green tea extract powder, Kava, lobelia, methylsynephrine, pennyroyal oil, red yeast rice, usnic acid, and Yohimbe. The report warns against the use of these ingredients due to their potential health risks. The CDC has reported that the use of dietary supplements in the United States is common, with over forty percent of the population using them from 1998 to 2004. Multivitamins and multiminerals are the most commonly used products.

Nigerian police are investigating a video of a boy being beaten and set on fire for allegedly stealing food. The victim's age and location are disputed, with some reports claiming he was a seven-year-old attacked in Lagos, while others say he was in his twenties and part of a robbery gang. The police have stated that the video does not suggest the assault occurred in Lagos. The footage has sparked outrage and calls for justice to be served.

The text describes an undercover investigation into the exploitation of Syrian refugees and children in the garment industry in Turkey. The investigation reveals that many Syrian refugees, who lack work permits, are forced to work illegally in factories for low wages. The factories often hide workers during audits and continue exploiting them once the auditors leave. Some brands are aware of the abuses and are trying to address them, but others are unaware of the conditions in their supply chain. The investigation concludes that until brands have full visibility into their supply chain, the exploitation of refugees and children is likely to persist.

Millions of trees across the United States are dying due to a combination of factors including disease, insects, drought, and wildfires, all exacerbated by climate change. One example is the rapid ohi'a death disease in Hawaii, which has infected nearly 50,000 acres of native forest. The cause of this disease is still unknown, and scientists are struggling to find a treatment. In California, an invasive pathogen called Sudden Oak Death is killing millions of trees, including redwoods. Bark beetles and mountain pine beetles are also wreaking havoc on forests, expanding their range due to climate change. The loss of trees has far-reaching consequences, affecting clean water, carbon storage, and entire ecosystems. Scientists are working on genetic research to understand why some trees are able to survive these threats, but they warn that in a few decades, American forests may be unrecognizable.

The Marrakesh Climate Talks are taking place amidst dangerously hot weather in North Africa. Record-breaking temperatures this summer have raised concerns about the impact of climate change on the region. Even if warming is limited to 2°C, the Mediterranean region would still experience unprecedented changes. Morocco could face increased temperatures and drought, leading to the displacement of forests and expansion of deserts. The fossil fuel industry's recklessness is pushing the planet towards catastrophe, and urgent action is needed to address this. Governments must divest from climate destruction and invest in renewable energy. Ending fossil fuel subsidies and removing the industry's influence from climate talks are crucial steps. Legal action is also being taken against major carbon emitters. The demand to world leaders is to stop new fossil fuel projects and transition to 100% renewable energy.

Former President Vladimir Voronin, who is chairman of the communist party, stated that presidential candidates should be married and campaign with their spouses. He refused to even shake Sandu's hand, calling her a ""betrayal of family values"" and a ""national disgrace."" Bishop Marchel, a leader in the Moldovan Orthodox Church, also attacked Sandu, claiming that her attitude towards Christian morality diverges from normal principles. Sandu defended herself, stating that being a single woman is not a shame. Voronin also criticized Sandu's opponent, Igor Dodon, but implied that Dodon is a preferable choice. Sandu has campaigned on a pro-European Union platform, while Dodon aligns his views with those of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

A recent study has found that rates of toddlers and preschoolers being hospitalized for opioid overdoses have more than doubled in recent years. The study analyzed data from over 13,000 records of children admitted to U.S. hospitals between 1997 and 2012. The increase in overdoses is possibly due to the rise in prescribed painkillers, such as OxyContin and Vicodin. Young children are often exposed to these drugs by finding pills on the floor, getting into their parents' purses, or opening bottles. The study emphasizes the need for parents to limit children's exposure to these medications and for companies to improve packaging. The study also highlights the underreported issue of young overdoses in the pediatrics community. Additionally, the study found that heroin poisonings among children increased by 161%.

The healthcare system in the United States is ill-prepared to treat obese patients, with doctors often unwilling to look past their weight and provide proper care. Obese patients face difficulties ranging from inadequate equipment to biased attitudes from healthcare providers. Doctors may spend less time with obese patients, fail to refer them for diagnostic tests, and attribute symptoms to their weight without investigating other causes. The lack of appropriate medical care for obese patients extends to treatments, with drug doses often not calibrated for obese patients and surgeons refusing to perform joint replacements unless the patient loses weight. The situation is further complicated by the fear of medical professionals of being penalized for complications and poor outcomes. The article also discusses the challenges faced by doctors and therapists in providing medical care to transgender patients due to limited knowledge and bias.

"More survivors of the Leviathan II tragedy, in which a whale-watching boat capsized and killed six people, have filed a lawsuit against the tour operator. The lawsuit describes the terrifying moments after the boat capsized, with the ship pitching and rolling in significant waves caused by a shallow reef. The captain had stopped the boat to view sea lions when a swell rose into a larger wave, causing the vessel to heel over. One of the plaintiffs, Robert Goodfellow, was submerged beneath the sea for a considerable period of time before swimming to the surface. Another plaintiff, Marya Levin, pushed a cushion towards two other passengers who were in danger of being struck by rotating propellers. Goodfellow and Levin eventually reached a lifeboat and are now seeking damages from the tour operator for physical, mental, and emotional trauma. Other survivors have also filed lawsuits, including one detailing their attempts to escape the sinking ship and a class-action suit citing post-traumatic stress disorder. The tour operator has referred to the sinking as an ""act of god."""

The boat, which was overcrowded with up to 450 migrants, sank near the city of Rosetta. So far, 163 survivors have been rescued and four suspected human traffickers have been arrested. The search for more survivors will focus on the boat's cold storage room, where witnesses say around 100 people were trapped. This incident highlights the dangerous journey that migrants are taking to reach Europe, with Egypt becoming an increasingly popular departure point.

I don't think there are too many people that know about this information.  it's the first time I've ever heard of it.	A recent study suggests that men conceived through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a type of in vitro fertilization, may have lower sperm concentration and more fertility struggles compared to men conceived naturally. The study focused on 54 men conceived through ICSI and found that they had lower average sperm concentration, total sperm count, and total motile sperm count. The researchers suggest that couples should be informed about this potential outcome before undergoing ICSI. However, the study also found that a low sperm concentration in fathers did not necessarily match the values found in their sons. Therefore, some men conceived through ICSI may still be able to father children naturally. It is recommended for them to start trying to conceive at a younger age, as fertility declines with age.

Environmental groups are preparing for a fight, as these actions could have significant negative impacts on the planet. The biggest threats posed by the Trump administration include backing out of the Paris Agreement, killing the Clean Power Plan, eliminating the EPA, appointing climate change deniers to lead the EPA and Department of Energy, cutting federal spending on clean energy, avoiding regulations on methane, and opening federal lands to oil and gas drilling. However, it may be difficult for Trump to repeal and revise these regulations, and there is still hope for the planet as clean energy initiatives and pollution regulations have widespread support among the American people.

According to former Wells Fargo workers, the practice of opening unauthorized accounts to meet sales goals has been happening for much longer than the bank has admitted. The scandal, which involved the opening of as many as two million fake accounts since 2011, has led to the firing of 5,300 employees and an investigation by the Justice Department. One former branch manager, Susan Fischer, recalls being instructed to have her employees open unauthorized accounts in 2007. When she refused, she faced pressure and eventually had to take a medical leave of absence. Fischer is now speaking out to prevent this behavior from continuing.

I think it's really disgusting that Indonesia knows they need to preserve their land and wild life but still allows things like this to happen.	A palm oil company named PT Mohairson Pawan Khatulistiwa plans to clear more than half of the Sungai Putri forest in Indonesia, which is home to a critically endangered orangutan population. Despite the Indonesian government's commitment to protecting peat, forests, and orangutans, the company has been granted a license to destroy the forest. The forest is at risk of being converted into an industrial tree plantation, and the company has already started work on building a drainage canal. The destruction of the forest and the orangutans' habitat is incompatible with Indonesia's national action plan for orangutans. The development violates Indonesia's legal processes and international commitments. Improved management is needed in Sungai Putri to address illegal logging and fires. There are conflicting opinions on the deforestation, with some supporting it for potential employment opportunities and compensation, while others argue that it is unsustainable. Alternative solutions that involve collaboration between various stakeholders are available to fulfill development objectives and alleviate poverty in Indonesia.

Venezuela is currently facing political turmoil as President Nicolas Maduro's version of chavismo has brought chaos to the country and turned voters against him. The opposition has been pushing for a recall referendum to remove Maduro from power, but the government has been delaying and suspending the process. Venezuelans have taken to the streets in protest, but security forces and government sympathizers have responded violently. The military and paramilitary groups continue to support Maduro, but there are signs of cultural differences and potential divisions within the military. The opposition is calling for dialogue and negotiations, but many see it as a stalling tactic. The situation in Venezuela is uncertain and the future remains unclear.

It's a happy ending for the kid but I really wish both lived.	A federal report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has concluded that the barrier separating humans and primates at the Cincinnati Zoo was not in compliance with standards for housing primates when a child fell into the gorilla exhibit in May. The report issued a critical citation because the barrier failed and caused harm to an animal. However, before the incident, the zoo had not been cited for shortcomings with the barrier during previous inspections. The zoo has since updated the barrier and is now in compliance with federal standards. The family of the child who entered the enclosure has stated that they do not want to pursue legal action against the zoo. The USDA has issued 10 citations at the zoo in the last three years, but none were related to the gorilla exhibit. The Cincinnati Zoo officials have reaffirmed their commitment to the well-being of the animals and the safety of visitors. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) has stated that the zoo meets their standards related to barriers.

Gay men are unable to donate blood to victims of the Orlando shooting due to a year-long celibacy requirement imposed by the FDA. These regulations were implemented in 2015, supposedly ending the ban on gay men's blood, but still prevent even monogamous gay men from donating. The ban originated in 1983 during the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but the American Medical Association has called for its end, stating it is discriminatory and lacks scientific basis. Misinformation spread on social media falsely claimed the ban had been lifted in Orlando. The ban is seen as unjustified, and other countries, like Argentina, have already abolished it. The Council on American-Islamic Relations is helping to maintain blood supplies. The article calls for the end of this oppressive policy and highlights the need for continued resistance in the face of tragedy.

He was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, a rare disease that has a 25% fatality rate. Murken underwent multiple surgeries and spent three weeks in critical care before being able to return home. Despite the ordeal, he was able to ride his bike to work again in mid-August. The timing of his illness was unfortunate, as he was in the midst of working on Mayor Kenney's tax on sweetened beverages.

Wildfires near the Georgia-North Carolina line have led to evacuations and the need for residents to wear masks outdoors. The largest wildfire has burned over 13,000 acres and is only 20% contained. Special health masks are being distributed in North Carolina as regular surgical masks do not provide enough protection from smoke particles. Despite the smoke, the Charlotte Marathon was able to proceed as planned. Many of the wildfires are suspected arsons, with a dark blue SUV being sought in one case. In Tennessee, 72% of active wildfires are suspected arsons. In North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, over 20 wildfires are being investigated for suspected arson. The federal government has approved funding to fight the fires in western North Carolina. In South Carolina, residents are being asked to donate drinks to help firefighters battling a wildfire.

"The eldest generation in Russia, known as the ""children of the war,"" are living in poverty. Despite surviving World War II and other hardships, they are struggling to make ends meet on a meager pension. The falling ruble and rising prices have made it difficult for pensioners to afford basic necessities. Many have resorted to selling apples and relying on secondhand clothing and homegrown food. Medical care is also a challenge, as the cost of treatment is often too high. The government's response has been inadequate, offering a one-time payment instead of increasing pensions. Despite these difficulties, pensioners in Oryol have found solace in a DIY school for the elderly, where they can learn new skills and find companionship. However, they still long for a better quality of life and feel frustrated by the lack of support from the government."

A study suggests that legalizing the ivory trade would lead to the extinction of elephants, as the demand for ivory far exceeds what can be sustainably harvested. The researchers argue that even in the best-protected elephant populations, it is not possible to harvest enough ivory without driving the elephants to extinction. The demand for ivory in Asia results in the killing of around 27,000 elephants each year. The study emphasizes the need to focus on reducing demand for ivory in order to save elephants from extinction. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of accurately determining the amount of ivory within each country's borders to set sustainable quotas. The Kenya government recently destroyed over 100 tons of elephant ivory in an effort to combat the illegal ivory trade.

A man dressed as a construction worker vandalized Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, using a sledgehammer and pickax to smash the symbol. The man attempted to remove the star but was unsuccessful. He claimed that he wanted to auction the star to raise money for women who have accused Trump of sexual assault or harassment. The suspect was later arrested on a charge of felony vandalism. The star will be replaced, and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce intends to prosecute the vandal to the full extent of the law. Trump's star has been targeted multiple times in the past, with incidents of paint, graffiti, and other defacement.

I agree that just buying computers and being on the Internet doesn't guarantee that kids are receiving a good education.	The E-Rate program, which provides subsidies for schools to enhance internet connections, has received bipartisan support and billions of dollars in funding. However, a study in North Carolina found that the program had no benefits for students and actually hurt their performance. Other research has also shown little to no gains in student achievement with improved computer access. Despite this, the program has continued to receive funding and has been plagued with fraud and lax oversight. Additionally, the push for more advanced networks and expensive technology may not be necessary, as many educational resources do not require high bandwidth connections. The funding for E-Rate comes from a tax on long distance telecommunications, which disproportionately affects lower-income households. The article suggests suspending the program until its effectiveness can be objectively tested, and exploring other options for using the funds.

With just a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, major impacts are already being felt in natural systems. More than 80% of ecological processes that support healthy marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems show signs of responses to climate change. These impacts have consequences for humans, including increased pests and disease outbreaks, unpredictable changes in fisheries, and decreasing agriculture yields. Understanding the adaptive capacity in nature can help address these issues and apply the same principles to crops, livestock, and aquacultural species. The study emphasizes the need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as there are already significant and widespread impacts from climate change across biological systems.

His death was sudden and unexpected. Cohen, known for his religious imagery and themes of redemption and desire, was buried in Montreal next to his parents. He was born into a Jewish family and moved to New York in 1966 to pursue a career in music. Although he influenced many musicians and received numerous honors, Cohen rarely achieved mainstream success. His most famous song, ""Hallelujah,"" has been covered by countless artists. Cohen's work explored religion, love, politics, and the search for balance in life."

Hate crimes against Muslims in the United States reached their highest level since 2001, with a 67% increase in anti-Islamic incidents in 2015 compared to the previous year. Experts and advocates attribute this rise to anger over terrorist attacks and anti-Islam rhetoric during the presidential campaign. The Council on American-Islamic Relations blames the mainstreaming of Islamophobia by public figures like Donald Trump for the increase in hate crimes. Overall hate crimes increased by 6.7% in 2015, with anti-black, anti-Jewish, and anti-sexual orientation incidents also rising. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported 201 incidents of election-related harassment and intimidation, and there were reports of hateful acts before and after Trump's election. The data is limited as many law enforcement agencies do not report hate crimes voluntarily. Analysts believe that the spike in hate crimes against Muslims is due to anger after terrorist attacks, prejudice against Muslims, and the labeling of Muslims as enemies. The professor who wrote about the surge in crimes against Muslims expects that the levels of hate crimes in 2016 are either at or above those of 2015.

Kim Kardashian West was held at gunpoint in a robbery in Paris, where a group of men stole millions of dollars' worth of jewelry. The concierge, Abdulrahman, revealed that the robbers initially wanted money, not jewels. There was speculation that a diamond ring Kardashian West showed off on social media prompted the heist, but Abdulrahman clarified that the robber was only interested in money. After giving him the ring, the thief pocketed it and continued to demand money. Some jewels and gold were lost because the thief left the bag open. The police are still investigating, but no arrests have been made. Kardashian West has reduced her social media presence and public outings since the incident.

Russia has claimed that the UN aid convoy that was bombed in Syria on Monday night was escorted by terrorists, denying accusations that it was behind the attack. The convoy, which was delivering food aid to opposition-held parts of Aleppo, was hit shortly after the end of a ceasefire. The Russian defense ministry released drone footage showing a pickup truck carrying militants and a heavy mortar driving alongside the convoy before it was bombed. More than a dozen people were killed, including the director of the organization. The truce collapsed as leaders were gathered at the UN in New York to negotiate a longer-term peace plan. The US accused the Syrian government and Russia of violating the ceasefire, while Moscow accused the US-led coalition of aiding ISIS. The incident highlights the deep mistrust between the superpowers and the failure to achieve a lasting agreement to end the conflict.

Cows release methane gas, a greenhouse gas, which has a much higher negative effect on the climate compared to carbon dioxide. The livestock industry, including cattle breeding and farming, is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector. Livestock pastures and feed production use a significant portion of the Earth's land surface, leading to deforestation and habitat loss. The increasing demand for meat and dairy products contributes to the overgrowth of the farming industry and its impact on global warming. Producing one kilogram of beef emits an equivalent amount of CO2 as an average European car every 250 kilometers and consumes a significant amount of energy. Consuming less meat and dairy products is an effective way to reduce one's carbon footprint and protect the environment.

The Chicago Police Department is facing a digital archive that documents two decades of torture by its officers. The archive, called the Chicago Torture Archive, contains over 10,000 documents related to cases of torture between 1972 and 1991. These cases involved over 100 black men who were tortured by police officers to force confessions or intimidate witnesses. The archive, which will be housed at the University of Chicago, includes interrogations, trial files, journalism works, and records of activism. The launch of the archive coincides with recent efforts in Chicago to address police misconduct, including the passing of the Reparations for Burge Torture Victims ordinance. The archive's director hopes that the lessons learned from these cases can inform and inspire young activists. While the archive provides a comprehensive resource for studying the cases, there are concerns about privacy and whether victims and their families were made aware of the archive's existence. Despite these concerns, the archive is seen as an essential tool for academics, researchers, and historians to understand this dark chapter in Chicago's history. It also presents an opportunity for the police department to mend relationships with residents and increase transparency and accountability.

A man named Christopher Cadenbach killed his two young sons and then himself in an apparent murder-suicide. Cadenbach was wanted for domestic violence and the police had been searching for him. His mother became concerned when he said he wouldn't be taken alive, so she alerted the police. An Amber Alert was issued for his two abducted sons. The police found Cadenbach in a local park and as soon as they arrived, he started shooting his children. The police tried to engage him, but he ultimately took his own life.

And the fact that the WHO recommends taxation at 75 percent of retail cost and NO states do this is crazy!	A new study reveals that 28.6% of cancer deaths in the United States are caused by smoking. The research considered 12 smoking-related cancers and found that smoking is involved in 22.9% of cancer deaths in women and 33.7% in men. In 2014, an estimated 167,133 people died from smoking-related cancers. However, this number does not include deaths from other smoking-related diseases. The study also highlights geographic variations, with higher percentages of smoking-related cancer deaths in certain states. Tobacco control efforts have been credited with preventing eight million premature deaths, but many parts of the country still have weak tobacco control policies. The analysis only focused on cigarettes, excluding other smoking methods and secondhand smoke. The data relies on self-reports, which may underestimate smoking prevalence. The tobacco industry still holds influence, particularly in Southern states where most tobacco is grown.

Can you imagine a world in which our children can never go camping or hiking in the wilderness because it has all been destroyed and turned into buildings??	A study has found that humans have destroyed about 10 percent of Earth's wilderness since 1992, equivalent to an area half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of Alaska. The research team from Australia's University of Queensland defines wilderness as an area with no human development. The destruction is primarily due to activities such as logging, agriculture, mining, and oil and gas exploration. The study aims to raise awareness and calls for international policies to protect remaining wilderness areas. The loss of wilderness is particularly significant in South America, which has experienced a 30 percent decline. The researchers warn that once wilderness is gone, it cannot be restored, emphasizing the need to protect what is left. The report criticizes the United Nations and others for ignoring the problem and highlights the urgency of taking action to prevent further loss.

At least 239 migrants are believed to have drowned in two shipwrecks off the coast of Libya this week, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Survivor accounts suggest that two overcrowded boats broke up just off the Libyan coast on Wednesday. The 31 survivors were taken to the Italian island of Lampedusa. If true, these shipwrecks bring the toll of dead and missing in the Mediterranean to 4,220 this year, the highest on record. Most of the migrants appear to have come from sub-Saharan Africa. The European Union is conducting a search-and-rescue operation in the western Mediterranean, but the focus remains on deterrence rather than protection. The shifting migration patterns have been a boon to smugglers, as demand has increased across the trickier North African route.

Younger children may attempt suicide impulsively due to bad relationships with family and friends, while older children may do so because of relationship issues. Warning signs for suicide in children include increased sadness, irritability, anger, loss of interest in friends or activities, and saying mean or derogatory things. It is important for parents to talk to their children and listen to their feelings. There is limited research on suicide in children, and experts hope that the report will raise awareness and lead to more prevention efforts.

There has been more fighting from the Saudis in nearby Yemen.  The United States continues to supply the Saudis with weapons and intelligence, despite the atrocious use they will be put to.  These war crimes seem to be increasingly commonplace, yet the US continues to pursue the almighty dollar in supporting Saudi Arabia.	The US-backed air campaign in Yemen has been accused of war crimes, with rights groups and UN officials stating that the coalition has disregarded civilian casualties and failed to distinguish between civilian and military targets. Nearly 4,000 civilians have been killed in the war, with 60% of them dying in airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition. The war has caused widespread hunger and displacement, and warplanes have targeted medical centers, schools, and infrastructure. The US provides intelligence and logistical help to Saudi Arabia, but has reduced the number of military personnel advising the coalition. The coalition claims to investigate violations, but critics argue that the backing from the US and international community has given them a free rein. The strike on a hospital in Abs exemplifies the problems with the airstrikes, as the hospital was on a list of sites not to be targeted and had markings to indicate it was a medical facility. The strike has had a significant impact, with Doctors Without Borders pulling its personnel from northern Yemen and leaving the Abs hospital closed. Experts argue that the strikes on the taxi and hospital constitute war crimes.

"A British banker, Rurik Jutting, has been found guilty of murdering two Indonesian women in Hong Kong. The jury returned unanimous verdicts after a two-week trial, highlighting the significant inequality in Hong Kong and the decadent lifestyles of some expatriates. Jutting, who was sentenced to life in prison, has the right to appeal but has indicated that he will request a transfer to a British prison. The judge described the case as one of the most horrifying murder cases in Hong Kong and called Jutting an ""archetypal sexual predator."" The families of the victims welcomed the verdict but expressed that the sentence does not compare to the pain they have endured."

Underdeveloped countries are especially going to be affected by diminishing crops due to climate change.	"A study has found that projected climate change by 2070 will occur too quickly for grass species, including wheat, corn, rice, and sorghum, to adapt. This poses a risk to the world's ability to grow enough food, as these species provide almost half of the calories consumed by humans. The grass family is not only important for diets but also for global biodiversity and ecosystems. The study compared the rates of climate change niche change in grass species with projected climate change and found a significant difference. This suggests that many grass species may disappear from certain locations. While the study did not focus on food security, it highlights the potential problems for farmers growing food crops. However, there is ongoing research to develop ""climate-proof"" food crops using wild relatives of domesticated species. Unfortunately, these wild relatives are also at risk from climate change."

A man is suing Royal Caribbean after his husband fell overboard during a Caribbean cruise and died. The lawsuit claims that the cruise line failed to make a timely attempt to save him or recover his body. The husband alleges that they were subjected to homophobic taunts and slurs from crewmembers before the incident. The argument escalated, and the husband fell off the stateroom balcony, landing on a lifeboat before falling into the ocean. The complaint states that security officers failed to secure and rescue him. The Coast Guard performed a search-and-rescue operation, but the body was never found.

"PTSD is a misunderstood and stigmatized disorder that affects many veterans. It is estimated that 8 million Americans suffer from PTSD, with rates among Vietnam War and Iraq War veterans being particularly high. The negative connotations surrounding PTSD prevent many veterans from seeking help. Veterans want others to know that referring to them as ""weak"" is ignorant, as war experiences are incomprehensible to those who haven't lived through them. PTSD symptoms can be masked and go unnoticed, making it difficult to recognize. Many PTSD sufferers suffer in silence, fearing judgment and trying to appear strong. Contrary to popular belief, PTSD does not make individuals violent. Recovery from PTSD is possible, and veterans encourage others to seek help and know that they are not alone."

The report emphasizes that the fight against measles is hindered not by a lack of tools or knowledge, but by a lack of political will to ensure every child is immunized. While vaccination campaigns and increased routine vaccine coverage have saved millions of lives, there are still countries where a majority of children are not vaccinated. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan account for half of all unvaccinated babies and 75% of measles-related deaths. Outbreaks of measles in various countries, caused by gaps in immunization, remain a significant problem. The report highlights the need to immunize young people who have missed out on vaccinations and notes that measles tends to resurge during conflicts or humanitarian crises.

Unlike other crops, coconuts cannot be stored in seed vaults due to their high water content, so maintaining living gene banks is necessary. However, these gene banks require a lot of space and are vulnerable to land grabs. Additionally, growing and breeding coconuts is challenging due to their long maturation period and the need for hand pollination. Efforts to isolate and freeze coconut embryos for preservation are still unreliable. Funding for coconut gene banks is also limited, as most coconut growers are small farmers. The future of the Coconut Genetic Resources Network (COGENT) is uncertain due to funding issues.

Many employees suffered from stress-induced migraines, severe anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems due to the high-pressure work environment and unethical practices. Some employees were rewarded for using unethical practices to meet unrealistic sales goals, while others were constantly observed and critiqued by managers. The experiences of these employees highlight the toll that a toxic work culture can have on mental health. Wells Fargo has acknowledged its failures and is making changes to support its employees and uphold a customer-focused culture. The extreme stress and involvement in illegal activity can worsen mental health problems. Even managers at the bank experienced severe depression and anxiety. The mental health nightmares extended to employees in the mortgage division as well, with bullying, punishment, and intimidation being common. Employees were constantly measured against each other and bonuses were sometimes blocked. The lack of compassion from supervisors during personal crises led some employees to quit. The experiences of these employees have left a lasting impact on their mental health and perception of Wells Fargo.

Four Americans were killed in a suicide bomb attack at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. The attack also wounded 16 US service members and one Polish soldier. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it had been planned for four months. The US Embassy in Kabul will be closed as a precautionary measure. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg expressed support for those affected by the attack and reiterated NATO's commitment to fighting terrorism. Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. Urgent investigations are being carried out to determine how the attacker gained access to the base. This attack follows a series of recent attacks in Afghanistan, including a suicide car bomb targeting the German Consulate and a joint Afghan-US battle against the Taliban that resulted in civilian and military casualties.

Climate change can affect the habitats of wild animals and cause them to die from things like lack of water, which is still a big deal. It's not the temperature change necessarily but what happens to things like the habitat.	New research suggests that habitat degradation poses a greater risk to the survival of turtles and tortoises than rising global temperatures. Over 60% of these species are listed as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered due to factors such as trading, collection for food and medicine, and habitat degradation. The study used climate models and the fossil record to investigate the impact of long-term climate change on these species. Results show that turtles and tortoises were able to withstand warmer climates in the past as long as there was enough water to support them. However, they are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, making climate change a significant threat to their conservation status.

According to FBI data, murders in the US increased by 10.8% in 2015, the largest single-year percentage jump since 1971. The rise in violence was driven by an increase in the murders of black men and an increase in gun murders. The number of firearm murders increased by roughly 1,500, while knife murders dropped slightly. The percentage of murders committed with guns increased to 71.5%. Despite the increase in murders, overall crime rates did not increase substantially. The attorney general mentioned the overall increase in violent crime but did not mention the increase in murders. A third of the murder increase was driven by ten larger cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Black men and women face less violence today than in the early 1990s. In a separate incident, two New Jersey Transit buses crashed in the Lincoln Tunnel, injuring as many as 44 people.

We really don't think of air pollution all that much in most of the country, but it seems to be significant problem in certain larger areas. Apparently India is having a lot of issues with it, and it's making people sick. It's really sad when places put more emphasis on businesses than they do on the health of the people.	Protesters in New Delhi took to the streets to express their anger at the government's slow response to the city's severe air pollution crisis. The toxic smoke, caused by factors such as low winds, holiday fireworks residue, and crop-burning in neighboring states, has led to the closure of schools, canceled cricket matches, and a surge in patients with breathing problems. The air quality, measured by the PM 2.5 particulate pollutant, was more than six times the acceptable level. The city's chief minister announced emergency measures, including banning construction activity, limiting diesel-generator use, and closing a coal-fired power plant. However, experts argue that more long-term solutions are needed, such as expanding public transport and permanently closing aging coal-fired plants. The burning of crop waste in neighboring states is a major contributor to the pollution, and the government is being urged to take action. Protesters, including schoolchildren, are demanding immediate action to address the pollution crisis.

It's very interesting that this is starting to change though, as male products become a bigger market for companies."	Male models are being paid up to 75% less than women, according to a top modelling agent. Elizabeth Rose, who manages male models at Premier, believes it is unfair and not a form of female empowerment. She explains that women can be paid up to £40,000 for a top show, while male models only receive £10,000 on average. However, she notes that the situation is slowly changing as advertisers are increasingly using male models for grooming products. Elizabeth also highlights that the top 10 female models all make millions, whereas only the top three male models earn over a million. She tries to negotiate higher fees for male models but acknowledges that women face more discrimination due to their age. Elizabeth believes that change can happen if more agents and models refuse to accept unequal pay.

A fuel tanker explosion in northern Mozambique killed 73 people and injured 110 others. The incident occurred as residents gathered around to buy fuel from the driver. Charred bodies were found at the blast site, and more bodies may be in the surrounding woods. Some badly burned individuals attempted to escape into a nearby river. The truck driver from Malawi had turned off the main road to sell fuel to locals when the fire broke out. Medical teams and searchers were dispatched to the scene, but their efforts were hindered by darkness. The cause of the explosion is still unknown, with theories suggesting a fire near the tanker or a lightning strike. A government task force is set to visit the site.

An investigation by Human Rights Watch has concluded that the deadly attack on a school in Syria was carried out by Syrian regime and Russian warplanes. Russia initially denied that any airstrikes had taken place, but satellite imagery and drone footage released by the Russian Ministry of Defence showed damage consistent with HRW's evidence. HRW has compiled video evidence and witness testimonies, and called on Russia to conduct a thorough investigation. This attack is one of many targeting civilian infrastructure in Syria, with over 4,200 schools damaged or destroyed during the six-year war. Efforts are being made to establish culpability for war crimes committed in Syria through the UN General Assembly and national courts in Europe and the United States.

The sisters' family is seeking answers and some members have traveled to the Seychelles to gather details and bring the bodies home. The Seychelles is a popular tourist destination known for its beaches and coral reefs. The sisters arrived on September 15 and were scheduled to leave on September 24.

Venezuelan children are fainting and falling asleep in school due to hunger. Many students are absent because their families cannot afford to buy food. One teacher reported that a student skipped class every Thursday because it was their family's designated day to buy food at government-regulated prices. Another teacher witnessed a child faint during a cultural event because they had only eaten an arepa at 10 a.m. and it was already 3 p.m. The government spends very little on meals in public schools, and a lawmaker criticized the government for prioritizing weapons over food. A recent poll revealed that 48% of the time children do not attend school, it is due to food-related issues. Many children eat only twice a day or even just once, and for some, the school lunch is their only meal of the day. Some parents are considering changing their children from private to public schools, while others are contemplating taking their children out of school altogether. In addition to the food crisis, public schools are also facing infrastructure problems, with stolen computers and desks and a lack of funds for school supplies.

Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, is facing a tough re-election fight after years of comfortable victories. His decision to embrace Donald Trump has worsened his chances of winning. His opponent, Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel, has received significant financial support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Issa has tried to fight back by highlighting accusations made against Applegate by his former wife. In another California district, Representative Jeff Denham is also facing a tough re-election fight. Denham, like Issa, has expressed support for Trump. Both districts have a large and growing Latino population, which is expected to vote against Trump. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC have invested over $4 million to defeat Issa and Denham. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, has given over $1.6 million to Denham. Denham's refusal to disavow Trump has put him at odds with the editorial board of The Modesto Bee, the largest newspaper in his district, which has endorsed his opponent, Michael Eggman.

Iraqi military and police forces have discovered a mass grave near the town of Hamam al-Alil, south of Mosul, containing around 100 decapitated bodies. The bodies were found at an agricultural college and are currently being examined to determine their identities. The Iraqi Joint Command condemned the Islamic State for their crimes against the people. Meanwhile, Kurdish peshmerga forces recaptured the town of Bashiqa, with heavy fighting reported. The US officials stated that 33,000 Iraqi civilians have been displaced so far by the Mosul operation, lower than expected. Aid organizations estimate that up to 1.5 million civilians have been living in Mosul under Islamic State control, and at least 700,000 are expected to be displaced. The international community is preparing for a humanitarian emergency, with emergency relief supplies being brought to areas where displaced people are expected to go. The United States is assisting in preparations for governance in Mosul and vetting the displaced, but these tasks will be handled by the Iraqi and regional Kurdish governments.

Iraqi Christians who were brutalized by the Islamic State and betrayed by their neighbors doubt they will ever be able to return to Mosul. The advance of the Islamic State scattered religious and ethnic minorities in the area, and the future of the region will be defined by who decides to return. While some villagers express hope in rebuilding and staying, others believe the area is lost and will only get worse. Iraq's news media has been showing images of soldiers recapturing desecrated churches, implying that it will soon be safe for Christians to return. However, Christians have been leaving Iraq for years, and community leaders say it will be difficult to go back to Mosul due to the pain and threats they experienced. Many Christians who do return would likely only do so to sell their houses and leave.

A suspected serial killer in Anchorage, Alaska was stopped by a police officer who was responding to a theft complaint. The officer, Arn Salao, was shot multiple times by the suspect, James Dale Ritchie, but managed to return fire and fight off his assailant. Another officer arrived at the scene and also fired at Ritchie, killing him. Ballistics tests revealed that the gun Ritchie used was the same one used in five other homicides in Anchorage in 2016. Ritchie had prior arrests for drugs and burglary and had recently returned to Alaska from West Virginia. Two of the victims linked to Ritchie's gun were identified as Jason Netter Sr. and Brianna Foisy, who were found dead in July. Another two victims, Bryant De Husson and Kevin Schuyler Turner, were found dead in August. The motive behind the killings is unknown, and it is unclear if Ritchie knew any of the victims. The police believe that the chance encounter between Officer Salao and Ritchie may have saved countless lives. Two other unsolved double homicides in Anchorage have not been linked to Ritchie.

"President Obama oversaw significant growth in federal spending to reduce inequality, but President-elect Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress are likely to undo these measures. Trump's proposed policies, such as building a border wall, deporting undocumented workers, and cutting taxes, could lead to financial panic and a possible recession. The repeal of Obamacare and the proposed tax cuts would disproportionately affect the poor, with millions potentially losing access to healthcare and the highest-income taxpayers benefiting the most. In order to balance the budget, the GOP would need to make significant spending cuts, which would likely impact assistance programs for the young and poor. Trump's vague plans make it unclear which specific policies would be eliminated, but House Speaker Paul Ryan's ""A Better Way"" plan provides some insight into potential cuts. Overall, Trump's presidency could make it much harder to be poor in America and represents a repudiation of Obama's economic policies."

"Mikhail Y. Lesin, a former aide of Russian President Vladimir Putin, died from head injuries sustained in accidental falls after excessive drinking, according to authorities in Washington. Lesin, who helped create the Kremlin's Russia Today television network, was found dead in a D.C. hotel room in November 2015. Initially ruled as ""undetermined,"" the manner of death has now been amended to an accident with acute ethanol intoxication as a contributing cause. Lesin's death was caused by blunt-force injuries to his head, as well as injuries to his neck, torso, arms, and legs from falls. The investigation determined that Lesin entered his hotel room for the final time after days of excessive alcohol consumption and was found dead the next morning. The ruling of accidental death has been accepted by the interim D.C. police chief. Lesin was known for his role in the Kremlin-dominated media landscape and his volatile temper. He resigned as head of Gazprom-Media in 2014 and kept a low profile until his death. Speculation about his death included theories of foul play due to his land dealings in California, but a friend and business associate believed he died after heavy drinking."

Justin Ross Harris, a man from Georgia, is on trial for leaving his infant son to die in a hot car. Prosecutors argue that Harris left his son in the car for seven hours because he was pursuing extramarital affairs. Defense attorneys admit Harris's philandering but argue that his son's death was a tragic accident. The fate of Harris is now in the hands of the jurors. The trial has gained significant publicity, leading to the proceedings being moved 300 miles away. Harris faces charges of malice murder, felony murder, and cruelty to children. The prosecution emphasized Harris's illicit chats with women, including underage girls, on the day of his son's death. The defense argues that Harris's sexual behavior is unrelated to the death. The prosecution highlighted the position of the car seat as evidence that Harris could see his son. The defense claims that the investigation was biased and misled the jurors.

The message, likely sent by the Syrian government, also gave rebels an ultimatum to surrender or be killed. While there were no reports of bombardment by Monday afternoon, witnesses spotted fighter jets in the city. Russian warplanes have been backing the regime with airstrikes since September, causing destruction in Aleppo. The UN warned that the city is on the brink of starvation and lacks essential supplies. Turkey has been carrying out airstrikes in northern Syria to support the Free Syrian Army and plans to move on to Manbij after liberating al-Bab from ISIS. This move has stirred sectarian tensions and complicated efforts to free Syrian cities from ISIS control. Turkey considers some Kurdish militia groups as terrorists, while the US supports and arms them. The conflict between the US and Russia over which groups to target in Syria further complicates the situation.

A new study from Harvard and Columbia universities estimates that the haze from Indonesian fires last year may have caused over 100,000 premature deaths in Southeast Asia. The previous official death toll was only 19 deaths in Indonesia. The fires, set to clear land for palm oil and pulpwood plantations, occur mainly on Sumatra and Borneo, with the haze blowing over Singapore and Malaysia. The study combined satellite data with health impact models and pollution readings to estimate that 91,600 deaths occurred in Indonesia, 6,500 in Malaysia, and 2,200 in Singapore. The study only looked at health impacts on adults and the effect of fine-particulate matter, not the impact on children or other toxins produced by the fires. Last year's fires were among the worst in memory, causing widespread illness and diplomatic tensions. In other news, Samoa experienced a rare hail storm, causing disbelief among residents who thought it was a hoax. This was only the second time hail has fallen in Samoa since records began. The storm lasted 10 to 15 minutes and produced small hail stones with no reported damage. Finally, Typhoon Meranti, the strongest typhoon to hit China this year, has left 28 people dead and 15 missing in the east of the country. The typhoon caused significant damage to houses and resulted in economic losses of over $2.5 billion.

Kesha revealed in an interview with The New York Times magazine that she was under immense pressure to maintain a party girl image and dumb down her music while working with her former producer, Dr. Luke. She also stated that she was pressured to starve herself, which led her to check into a treatment center for eating disorders in 2014. Kesha has been open about her struggles with body image and has since taken steps towards reinvention. However, Dr. Luke's lawyer released a statement claiming that Kesha's allegations are false and part of a press campaign to mislead the public. The lawyer also stated that Kesha had the freedom to release music but chose not to until recently.

The reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who shot and killed a baby Salt River wild horse and wounded two others has increased to $25,000. Animal Recovery Mission, a non-profit organization, matched the existing reward fund. The Salt River Wild Horse Management Group, American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign, Humane Society of the United States, and Schill Law Firm also contributed to the reward. Despite the reward, no tips leading to the suspect's apprehension have been received. ARM Investigations, a coalition partner of the Salt River Wild Horse Management Group, decided to match the reward fund in hopes of encouraging a crucial tip. The organization fights animal cruelty and focuses on conservation programs. The witness saw a man shooting three Salt River wild horses, resulting in the death of a 6-month-old foal named Kai and injuries to two other horses. The horses are being monitored and treated by the SRWHMG. This is not the first time the wild horses of Salt River have been shot at, and the SRWHMG suspects they are being hunted. The organization is dedicated to protecting and studying the Salt River wild horses. The public can still contribute to the reward fund through a Go Fund Me page. The Maricopa Sheriff's department has not yet found any strong leads.

Over 3,800 people have died, averaging about 90 deaths per week. The largest migration of refugees since World War II is currently taking place, with over 65 million people displaced from their homes. Despite fewer people crossing this year compared to 2015, the death toll has increased. The main routes across the Mediterranean are from Turkey to Greece, Libya to Italy, and West Africa to Spain. Syria produces the most refugees, with nearly five million fleeing the country due to civil war. The war in Syria has also resulted in an estimated 430,000 deaths. While some refugees are resettled in countries like the United States and Canada, the majority seek asylum in Europe or remain in the Middle East. With no end to the war in sight, the refugee crisis and the loss of lives will continue.

The incident led to the closure of local beaches for 24 hours. The shark emerged from under the man while he was waiting for a wave, causing minor lacerations to his leg. The type of shark involved is unknown. This attack follows a similar incident in the same area a few weeks ago. The New South Wales coast has seen 14 unprovoked shark attacks in 2015, with a hotspot from Evans Head to Byron Bay. Efforts to control shark populations have been challenging, with a recent shark eco-barrier trial being canceled due to rough sea conditions. The government plans to increase tagging and relocation of sharks using ""smart drumlines"" to catch them. Shark attacks are on the rise due to the popularity of water sports and the movement of bait fish closer to shore, although fatalities are still rare."

"The Great Barrier Reef, although severely damaged, is not completely dead. It is currently on ""life support"" due to coral bleaching. The reef is home to numerous species and is considered the world's largest living thing. Preliminary findings show that 22% of its coral has died from the bleaching event. Climate change is the main cause of coral bleaching, as it leads to the expulsion of algae from the corals. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is conducting surveys to assess the impact of the bleaching. While scientists have expressed concerns about the reef's future, it is not beyond saving. The reef supports 70,000 jobs in reef tourism, and large sections of it are still in reasonable shape. The focus should be on better protecting the reef rather than giving up on it."

A woman was pushed to her death in front of a New York City subway train. The incident occurred at the Times Square station, and the victim was pronounced dead at the scene. The suspect, who was wearing a pink shirt and scarf, was apprehended by police. The motive is still under investigation, but witnesses mentioned a possible dispute between the victim and the suspect. The incident caused a temporary disruption in subway service. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority states that while many subway incidents are accidental, dozens of people are hit by trains each year. In a similar case in 2012, a woman was convicted and sentenced to 24 years in prison for pushing a man into the path of a subway train.

Afghanistan is facing a looming humanitarian crisis as the number of displaced people continues to rise. Over a million people were already uprooted last year, and this year, at least another million Afghans are on the move within the country and across its borders. The violence and conflict in Afghanistan have forced many to flee, while others are escaping poverty and drought. The United Nations and other aid agencies are struggling to provide emergency assistance, and if they fail, it will become a full-blown crisis. The country has been plagued by massive displacement since the Soviet invasion in 1979, and the current violence is some of the worst since the Taliban was toppled. The clashes between Afghan and Taliban forces have pushed even more people from their homes. The government is unable to reach all affected areas, and the Taliban now controls more territory than at any time since 2001. The return of refugees to areas controlled by insurgents is a concern, as it could exacerbate insecurity and joblessness. The displaced are often rejected and forced into squalid camps, with limited access to clean water and food. The situation is dire, and the government is incapable of creating jobs or improving the economy in remote areas. Criminal and terrorist networks may exploit the jobless and displaced youths, further deepening the crisis.

"Former Democratic senator Evan Bayh is facing a tough race against Republican candidate Todd Young in Indiana. Bayh has been attacked for his multiple homes, high earnings, and corporate ties. However, he still has a chance of winning, with recent polls showing a statistical tie between him and Young. Republicans are facing a cash crunch, with Bayh having a significant edge in ad spending. If Bayh wins, it would be a significant blow to GOP chances of holding their majority in the Senate. Bayh's entrance into the race was seen as a recruiting coup for the Democrats, and his bipartisan appeal has given him an advantage. Young's pitch is that Bayh has transformed from a centrist to a supporter of President Obama's agenda, using his positions to land post-Senate business. The attacks on Bayh's wealth resonate in Indiana, where the culture is parochial and politicians often emphasize their ""Hoosier"" identity. Bayh wants the race to focus on his accomplishments, such as the Evan Bayh 21st Century Scholars Program. However, the race has become increasingly negative, with outside groups playing a significant role."

Christ."	The Bramble Cay melomys, a reddish-brown rodent, recently made international news when it was declared extinct. While climate change played a role in its demise, human inaction was the ultimate cause. Rising sea levels due to climate change destroyed the melomys' habitat and food sources. However, it was revealed that Australian researchers had planned to start a captive breeding program for the melomys, but they were unable to find any individuals on Bramble Cay. This missed opportunity highlights the tragedy that had been unfolding for years. In a new paper, biologist John Woinarski and colleagues argue that the extinction of the melomys, along with two other Australian species, could have been prevented. The Christmas Island pipistrelle and Christmas Island forest skink also suffered from human neglect and inaction, allowing introduced predators to decimate their populations. Australia's biodiversity conservation law lacks explicit commitment to preventing human-caused extinctions, leaving species vulnerable. These extinctions are often overlooked due to the small size and remote locations of the species. Australia has the highest rate of mammal extinctions in the world, with 30 species lost since European colonization. Woinarski's assessment is driven by personal grief and a desire to learn from past mistakes. Australia still has over a thousand threatened and endangered species, and action is needed to prevent further extinctions. While climate change did contribute to the melomys' extinction, it is important to recognize the other environmental factors and the human choice to not save the species.

A study identified 94 core ecological processes, of which 82% showed evidence of impact from climate change. These impacts range from shifts in species ranges and changes in phenology to disruptions at the genetic and ecosystem levels. Species are adapting to temperature extremes, with changes in physiology and morphology. Changes in phenology, abundance, and distribution of species have also been observed. These impacts have implications for food security, as reduced genetic diversity, inconsistent crop yields, and decreased productivity in fisheries threaten resources. Changes in disease vectors and the emergence of novel pathogens and pests pose a direct threat to human health and resources. Understanding these impacts is crucial for adapting to and mitigating the influence of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

The story's a year or two old -- so once I've finished doing what I'm doing, I'm going to look up the paquita and see what's happened since then.	The vaquita, the most endangered marine mammal on Earth, is facing extinction due to gill net fishing and the illegal trade of totoaba. Urgent conservation measures were approved to protect the vaquita, including a permanent ban on gill net fishing and efforts to crack down on the totoaba trade. However, experts argue that these measures are not enough to save the species. The current plan neglects local livelihoods, fails to involve local fishermen in designing a sustainable management plan, and does not adequately address the totoaba trade. The ban on gill nets is seen as a step forward, but more interventions are needed to ensure the vaquita's recovery. This case highlights the challenges and complexities of endangered species conservation. Conservation efforts often come too late or lack the thoroughness needed to make a lasting impact. A long-term vision and proactive action are necessary to effectively conserve species and natural resources.

The economic crisis in Venezuela has led to a shortage of food, affecting both people and animals. Around 50 animals at Caricuao Zoo have starved in the last six months due to the rising cost of food caused by the economic downturn. The country's inability to import food and other necessities, along with skyrocketing inflation, has led to widespread hunger. Zoo staff have resorted to feeding carnivorous animals fruits and vegetables, and even slaughtered horses. The malnourishment of animals can have long-lasting health effects, including psychological issues. Other zoos in Venezuela are also struggling to feed their animals and are seeking donations. The situation in Venezuela is not unique, as animals in other countries, such as Gaza and Yemen, are also suffering due to poor social climates and conflicts. Animal rights organizations are working to address these issues and provide assistance to the affected animals.

A study suggests that garden ponds are contributing to the spread of deadly frog diseases in the UK. Ranaviruses, which can infect amphibians, reptiles, and fish, have devastated common frog populations. The research indicates that infected animals from aquatic retailers or the movement of species between ponds may be worsening the problem. The virus appears to be spreading faster than frogs can hop, and human-aided dispersal is likely involved. Ranaviruses are a group of viruses found worldwide, and they can kill common frogs by causing sores and blisters on their skin or internal bleeding. Genetic records suggest that ranavirus was introduced to the UK on two separate occasions. Garden ponds can act as stepping stones for infected animals to reach new sites, and the transfer of frogspawn or frogs between ponds may be aiding the spread of the virus. The study emphasizes the need to manage the risk of disease outbreaks while still supporting wildlife by adding ponds to urban gardens. Limiting the movement of potentially-infectious material is strongly advised.

The text discusses the forgotten victims of the drought in the western United States, particularly in Nevada. The lack of rain and snow has caused reservoirs to reach record lows, rivers to dwindle, and lakes to disappear. The drought has had devastating effects on the Native American tribes in Nevada, such as the Yomba Reservation, where ranchers have been forced to sell off their herds. The drought not only has ecological and economic impacts but also sociological and psychological ones, leading to domestic violence, substance abuse, and a sense of displacement. The article also mentions the importance of preserving native cultures and the efforts being made to help tribal communities survive the drought.

The zoo, known as the ""world's worst zoo,"" had a history of neglect and animal deaths, including taxidermy of dead animals. The rescue mission was complicated due to the ongoing conflict in the region, but the team successfully evacuated the animals and transferred them to sanctuaries. The rescue has been hailed as a milestone in animal rights, but concerns remain about the wider issues of wildlife trafficking and the commercialization of wild animals in Gaza. The rescued animals will now receive care and rehabilitation in their new homes. There are hopes to create new legislation in Gaza to address these issues and prevent animal smuggling.

The story of Emilie, who took her own life in January, and the dramatization of Marion Fraisse's story, who died three years ago, have shed light on the issue of bullying in France. The film adaptation of Marion's story, titled ""Marion, 13 ans pour toujours - Marion, Forever 13,"" portrays the gradual descent of a young girl into depression and suicide. The film has prompted a discussion on social media, with many sharing their own experiences of bullying. France has attempted to address the problem with an anti-bullying law and a hotline for reporting incidents, but activists argue that more needs to be done. The issue of bullying extends beyond the school gates, with cyber-bullying also being a concern. Parents, teachers, and students are encouraged to openly discuss the problem to find a solution. Emilie's story, published in her diary, highlights the emotional and physical abuse she endured at school. A report by Unicef states that bullying is a global issue with severe negative effects on children's mental health. The recent attention on these tragic cases may lead to a change in how bullying is addressed in France."

The expulsion is seen as an appeasement to Erdogan's demand to close schools linked to exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan accuses of orchestrating a coup attempt. Turkey has arrested tens of thousands of people suspected of ties to Gulen since the coup, and Erdogan has pressured other countries to aid in the crackdown. Pakistan is one of the few countries to comply. The affected schools deny any affiliation with political organizations and are petitioning against the expulsions. Over 400 Turkish citizens will have to leave Pakistan, but Erdogan reassured the students that they would not suffer.

The United Nations has expressed concern over the sharp increase in civilian casualties in Yemen since peace talks collapsed last month. The majority of these casualties were caused by airstrikes from a coalition led by Saudi Arabia. At least 329 civilians have been killed and 426 injured since the beginning of August. Saudi Arabia and its allies are trying to prevent an international investigation into possible war crimes. The United States and Britain, major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia, are finding it harder to ignore the bloodshed. The most recent example of the carnage was an airstrike on a market and residential area in Hodeidah, which killed at least 26 civilians. The United Nations has documented numerous attacks on civilian facilities by both coalition and rebel forces. Doctors Without Borders has pulled staff members out of six hospitals in Yemen after coalition planes bombed a facility. The United Nations has also expressed concern over the blockade of the city of Taiz, which has left residents critically short of food and water. The majority of civilian casualties have been caused by the Saudi-led coalition, according to a report to the Human Rights Council. Saudi Arabia and President Hadi's government have condemned the report as biased and have proposed a Yemeni commission to investigate human rights violations. Rights groups argue that a national body lacks expertise and that its reporting falls short of international standards. The European Union has drafted a competing resolution calling for a United Nations mission to Yemen. The Council will decide how to proceed after a week of diplomatic negotiations. President Hadi accused Iran of blocking the path towards peace in Yemen.

A lot of very sad hardships, from Earthquakes destroying already terrible infrastructure, to intense poverty. It makes me want to help the people.	The text highlights the ongoing disaster in Haiti caused by Hurricane Matthew, which has received little media coverage compared to previous disasters. The hurricane has caused significant material damage, including the destruction of houses, crops, and trees, as well as a spike in cholera cases. The lack of urgency and support from the central government and international agencies has frustrated local officials and community organizations. The slow response has led to desperation among the affected population, with some resorting to looting. The centralization of resources in Port-au-Prince and limited aid funds have contributed to the dire situation. The priority now is to support farmers in the affected regions to recover and rebuild their livelihoods. The Lambi Fund of Haiti is working with partner organizations to clean canals, clear fields, and provide local seeds for planting. The text emphasizes the need for awareness and support from the international community to help Haiti achieve food sovereignty and recover from the disaster.

"The author criticizes the Republican Party for not defending women against Donald Trump's sexist remarks and behavior. She questions why GOP leaders did not stand up for women after they had defended the party against accusations of sexism for years. The author suggests that the party prioritized appealing to certain voters over appealing to women. She argues that Trump's comments were not just ""locker room talk"" but a confession of assault. The author highlights how the Republican Party ignored Trump's chauvinism and even used their influence to force Republicans to support him. She believes that the GOP will suffer in the election and calls for the political obituaries of Trump's defenders. The author concludes by stating that she will not vote for Trump and warns that the GOP will lose the women's vote if they do not defend them."

The Supreme Court has halted the execution of an Alabama death row inmate, Thomas D. Arthur, for the seventh time. The execution was scheduled for Thursday evening but was stayed as officials waited for the Supreme Court to consider his appeals. Justice Clarence Thomas issued an order halting the execution until further notice. The court later granted Arthur's stay request, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voting in favor as a courtesy to his colleagues. The stay will remain in place until the justices decide whether to consider the case. Arthur was sentenced to death for the 1982 killing of Troy Wicker, the husband of a woman with whom Arthur had an affair. His attorneys argued against Alabama's lethal injection protocol and suggested execution by firing squad instead. The state's Department of Corrections is only allowed to carry out executions by injection and electrocution. Alabama's death penalty system has faced increased scrutiny following a Supreme Court ruling that struck down Florida's death penalty system.

The ongoing crisis in Flint, Michigan has prompted other communities to test for lead, including the Chicago Park District. Testing revealed that nearly a quarter of outdoor fountains and 14 indoor fountains and sinks exceeded the federal standard for lead levels. Some fountains had lead levels 80 times higher than the permissible level. All fountains and sinks with high lead levels have been disabled and will undergo further testing and repairs. The lack of adequate testing for lead in public settings is a national problem, according to public health officials. Lead can have serious health effects, especially in young children, and there is no safe level of lead in the body. Lead pipes and fixtures are still common in communities across the country. While taking a sip from a single fountain may not seriously affect health, it can contribute to cumulative lead exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations like the homeless and children.

Seven leaders of an armed militia who led a 41-day stand-off at a US federal wildlife refuge in Oregon have been acquitted of conspiracy and firearms charges. The occupation of the refuge, which began in January, was a protest against federal control of land. The defendants argued that they did not intend to prevent federal officers from going to work, and the jury was unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that they had. The acquittal has been seen as a victory for states' rights and a blow to the federal government. The case against a second group of defendants is due to go to trial in February.

A new study from the University of Washington, funded by NASA and other agencies, reveals that all 19 polar bear populations across the Arctic are facing a shorter sea ice season. The study, which is the first to quantify the sea ice changes in each polar bear subpopulation, shows a trend towards earlier sea ice melt in the spring and later ice growth in the fall. These changes negatively impact the feeding and breeding capabilities of the bears, as they rely on the sea ice for essential activities such as hunting and traveling. The study also found that the critical timing of the sea ice break-up and freeze-up is changing in all areas, which is harmful for polar bears. The researchers recommend that the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance be incorporated as measures of climate change in future reports.

The bad news is that people that have lung cancer that is exposed to air pollution may have a shorter survival time. Air pollution kills thousands of people each year. Researchers claim that the median survival for people diagnosed with early stages of lung cancer is expected to live 3 times shorter amount of time than those that do not. Of course, we all should stay away from cigarette smoke but it is unfortunate that we have air pollution. They can figure out a way to get to the moon but can not seem to figure out a way to clean our air.	sadness	2	2	1	60	74000	7.0	6.0	5.0	7.0	6.0	4.428999999999999	3.0	3.571	4.714	209	I am a 60-year-old female of the White race.

Of course, we all should stay away from cigarette smoke but it is unfortunate that we have air pollution. They can figure out a way to get to the moon but can not seem to figure out a way to clean our air.	A new study conducted in California has found that lung cancer patients exposed to air pollution may have shorter survival times. The research focused on California due to its wide range of air pollution levels and extensive air quality monitoring network. The study found that patients in areas with high levels of fine particulate matter had a median survival time of only 2.4 years, compared to 5.7 years in areas with lower pollution levels. Lung cancer patients whose cancer had spread to other parts of their bodies had shorter survival times overall, regardless of air pollution levels. The researchers suggest that newly diagnosed lung cancer patients should consider moving out of areas with high levels of air pollution. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in America, according to the CDC.

Airstrikes by a U.S.-backed Saudi-led coalition in the Yemeni city of Hodeidah killed at least 43 people and injured many more, according to Yemeni officials and local news reports. The strikes targeted a security complex where prisoners were being held. The city is controlled by Houthi rebels, who also control the capital and much of northern Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition claimed that the complex was being used as a command center by the rebels. The airstrikes occurred on the same day that Yemen's internationally recognized president rejected a new U.N. peace proposal. The conflict in Yemen has resulted in the deaths of over 10,000 people and has caused a humanitarian crisis in the country.

A deadly outbreak of bloodstream infections in Wisconsin has left health officials puzzled. The infections, caused by a species of bacteria called Elizabethkingia anophelis, have killed 15 people and sickened 33 others. The microbe is resistant to common antibiotics, making treatment difficult. The outbreak is unusual because the bacteria is typically found in hospitals, but many of the infected individuals have not had recent contact with healthcare facilities. Investigators are testing various products for contamination as a possible source. The outbreak is challenging to understand as little is known about Elizabethkingia. The bacteria is commonly found in soil and mosquitoes, and it thrives in moist biofilms. Previous outbreaks have been linked to contaminated taps in hospitals. The current outbreak is the first reported of this particular species of Elizabethkingia. Officials believe it is unlikely that the contamination comes from tap or groundwater, but the source remains unknown.

Women are concerned about the potential threat to affordable birth control under the Trump-Pence administration. Trump and Pence have expressed intentions to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which covers birth control. In response, some women are considering getting an intrauterine device (IUD) as a long-lasting form of birth control that could outlast any changes made by the administration. IUDs are highly effective and safe, with some versions lasting up to 12 years. Women are advised to take action soon, as an IUD can cost up to $1,000 without insurance coverage. Planned Parenthood offers a guide for those interested in learning more about IUDs. The fate of the Affordable Care Act and its birth control provisions is uncertain after President Obama leaves office on January 20, 2017.

Two girls in Myanmar who were kept prisoner and tortured for five years in a tailor shop have sparked outrage and an investigation. The police had previously refused to get involved despite pleas from the girls' families. The girls, who were sent to work in the shop at the ages of 11 and 12, were denied contact with their parents, not paid, and subjected to abuse. The case highlights the issue of child slavery in Myanmar, where at least a million children are forced to give up education and work. The authorities' handling of the case has angered the public, who see it as evidence of a biased judicial system. It was only when a journalist got involved that action was taken, leading to the arrest of the tailor and her two adult children. The president has ordered a report on how the police handled the case and is taking a closer look at the work of the human rights commission. The journalist involved is receiving a presidential award for his efforts.

People have put too much plastics into the oceans and pollute the living society of wild animals. It was danger to them if there is plastic around. I wish people will do a better jobs.	A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals that 90% of seabirds currently eat plastic in the ocean, and by 2050, virtually all seabirds will be consuming it. The research explains that seabirds rely on their sense of smell to hunt for food, and the scent emitted by plastic in the ocean tricks them into confusing it with food. The study also found that birds that track the scent of a sulfurous compound emitted by algae, which coats floating plastic, are six times more likely to consume plastic. The research sheds light on species that are often overlooked, such as petrels and shearwaters, which are impacted by plastic ingestion. The study highlights the need to address the growing plastic pollution in oceans, which affects not only seabirds but also sea turtles, fish, and other marine animals. The problem of plastic pollution starts on land, with nonpoint source pollution being one of the biggest contributors. The top five countries that dump plastics into oceans are China, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand.

"The US is facing an ""innovation crisis"" as other countries outperform it in measures of innovation. Economists attribute this decline to burdensome regulations and a weak job market. Some argue that the US's focus on individual self-reliance and smaller social safety net may discourage risk-taking. Studies show that demand-side factors, such as job insecurity and middling wage growth, are affecting entrepreneurship. Canada's maternity leave reform and France's unemployment insurance reform offer potential solutions to boost entrepreneurship. Policies that promote a tight labor market and full employment are crucial for the future strength of the US economy."

"Preliminary data released by the FBI show a 20% decrease in the number of police officers intentionally killed in the line of duty in 2015 compared to 2014. This contradicts the belief that increased criticism of police, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, has led to a ""war on cops."" However, the president of the national Fraternal Order of Police disagrees with the data and believes that officer deaths are increasing.

A Muslim woman wearing traditional garments had her clothes set on fire by a man with a lighter while shopping on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The woman noticed her blouse was on fire and saw a man with a lighter in his hand before he walked away. The incident is being investigated as a hate crime, but no suspects have been identified or arrested. This incident follows a recent attack where a Brooklyn woman allegedly beat two Muslim mothers and tried to rip off their hijabs. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has expressed concern over the increasing attacks on Muslims and called for more resources to prevent such incidents. Another attack in August involved a Queens man shooting and killing an imam and his assistant. The suspect in that case denies the charges.

"The residents of Matheny Tract, a poor community in California's Central Valley, have been living with contaminated water for years. They have had to pay for bottled water in addition to their tainted tap water. However, legislation based on the ""human right to water"" is now being implemented, and Matheny Tract will be the first community to receive clean water under this law. Similar legislation has been introduced in Michigan, but is still stuck in committee. The issue of water inequality in rural communities has been brought to the forefront by the state's record-breaking drought. Many small rural systems in California have contaminated water, affecting an estimated 160,000 people. These communities often lack public investment and are overlooked by their local governments. The right to water is seen as a fundamental human right, and California's legislation is seen as a step towards addressing water inequality. The state has also introduced a publicly accessible database on water systems that are out of compliance. Matheny Tract is scheduled to receive clean water on June 1, marking a significant improvement for the community."

"More survivors of the Leviathan II tragedy, in which a whale-watching boat capsized and killed six people, have filed a lawsuit against the tour operator. The lawsuit describes the terrifying moments after the boat capsized, with the ship pitching and rolling in significant waves caused by a shallow reef. The captain had stopped the boat to view sea lions when a swell rose into a larger wave, causing the vessel to heel over. One of the plaintiffs, Robert Goodfellow, was submerged beneath the sea for a considerable period of time before swimming to the surface. Another plaintiff, Marya Levin, pushed a cushion towards two other passengers who were in danger of being struck by rotating propellers. Goodfellow and Levin eventually reached a lifeboat and are now seeking damages from the tour operator for physical, mental, and emotional trauma. Other survivors have also filed lawsuits, including one detailing their attempts to escape the sinking ship and a class-action suit citing post-traumatic stress disorder. The tour operator has referred to the sinking as an ""act of god."""

The prevalence of sleep disorders among veterans has increased from less than one percent in 2000 to about six percent in 2010. Sleep apnea is the most common sleep disorder among veterans, followed by insomnia. Veterans with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic diseases also have higher rates of sleep disorders. The study did not establish a direct link between PTSD and sleep disorders, but a follow-up study will examine this connection.

"Russia launched a major air offensive in Syria, targeting the rebel-held part of Aleppo just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with President-elect Donald Trump about their goals for ending the Syria crisis. The strikes were described as ongoing and were carried out by Russian Navy frigates and fighter jets. The Pentagon called the missile launches a ""show"" and stated that Russia already had enough firepower in Syria to cause serious damage. The Obama administration has been trying to negotiate a cease-fire in Aleppo for months, but the situation remains dire, with the city under siege and no aid allowed in since July.

I simply just can't let something like this, despite the risk, affect my feelings and emotions.	The future of the Zika virus is uncertain. Experts have different opinions on how long it will stick around and how often it will return. Some believe it will behave like other arboviruses, recurring regularly with upticks in cases during the rainy season. Others predict that it will vanish in a few years, similar to chikungunya. The current outbreak in the Americas is due to the fact that people in the region had no immunity to the virus. Future outbreaks may be smaller if people develop immunity, but there could also be long lulls between outbreaks, allowing for a buildup of younger people who aren't immune. It is unclear if there will be fewer cases of microcephaly in the future due to the immunity gained from Zika infections. The impact of mosquito control efforts on young girls getting infected is also uncertain. It is unknown if Zika will strike Africa and Asia with the same ferocity as the Americas, but experts believe the two strains of Zika will be cross-protective. The uncertainty surrounding Zika's future affects the prospects for a vaccine. If Zika activity subsides, it will be difficult to conduct clinical trials to prove the vaccine's effectiveness. However, the fear of the virus's impact on developing fetuses may continue to drive demand for a vaccine.

A former teacher, Alexandria Vera, has agreed to a plea deal after being accused of having a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old student. She pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child, a lesser charge than the original continuous sexual abuse charge. The relationship lasted for nine months, and Vera claimed that she and the victim loved each other. She said the boy's family accepted their relationship and even became excited when she became pregnant with his child. However, when Child Protective Services questioned her, she had an abortion. Neighbors reported seeing the boy at Vera's house frequently, and she claimed he was her brother. Vera will be sentenced in January, with prosecutors agreeing to a maximum term of 30 years. The boy will remain in foster care, and his parents have been ordered to undergo therapy and attend parent classes.

The Obama administration has announced that it will resume deportations of undocumented Haitian immigrants due to a surge in Haitian migrants seeking to enter the United States. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, deportations were suspended, but they were partially resumed later on for those convicted of serious crimes or considered a threat to national security. However, since last spring, thousands of Haitian migrants who had moved to Brazil for work have been making their way to the United States. These migrants have been allowed to enter the country and given permission to stay for up to three years under a humanitarian parole provision. With the full resumption of deportations, Haitians without visas will now be put into expedited removal proceedings. The surge in Haitian migrants has overwhelmed shelters in Tijuana, and many migrants have chosen to sleep on the streets. The change in American policy has surprised advocates in San Diego and Tijuana, who object to the policy change that does not reflect any actual change in reality.

It makes me crazy that people aren't paying attention and could care less about the snowball effect that is happening because of climate change. Because of us!	Millions of trees across the United States are dying due to a combination of factors including disease, insects, drought, and wildfires, all exacerbated by climate change. One example is the rapid ohi'a death disease in Hawaii, which has infected nearly 50,000 acres of native forest. The cause of this disease is still unknown, and scientists are struggling to find a treatment. In California, an invasive pathogen called Sudden Oak Death is killing millions of trees, including redwoods. Bark beetles and mountain pine beetles are also wreaking havoc on forests, expanding their range due to climate change. The loss of trees has far-reaching consequences, affecting clean water, carbon storage, and entire ecosystems. Scientists are working on genetic research to understand why some trees are able to survive these threats, but they warn that in a few decades, American forests may be unrecognizable.

The Cavendish banana, which is the most widely sold banana in the Western world, is facing the threat of extinction due to its vulnerability to diseases. The previous popular variety, Gros Michel, was wiped out by a fungal disease called Fusarium wilt. The Cavendish replaced it but is now susceptible to a disease called Black Sigatoka. Additionally, a new strain of Fusarium wilt called Tropical Race 4 (TR4) is spreading and could devastate the banana industry. To combat these diseases, scientists are studying the genetics of wild banana varieties and banana pathogens to find resistant genes. However, there has been little effort and funding for this research. By increasing genetic diversity in cultivated bananas, the industry can reduce its vulnerability to diseases. Scientists have already identified the genome sequences of bananas and the fungi causing the diseases, which provides a basis for identifying disease-resistant genes. With the use of genetic engineering and plant breeding, these genes can be transferred into desired cultivars. It is crucial to increase the pool of genetic diversity in cultivated bananas to avoid repeating the history of the Gros Michel and Cavendish varieties.

Nigeria is investigating reports of sexual abuse and rape of women and girls who survived Boko Haram violence. Human Rights Watch published a report detailing accounts of sexual abuse and coercion by camp leaders, vigilante group members, policemen, and soldiers at camps in Borno State. The Inspector General of Police has set up a special team to investigate the cases. The victims, many of whom were impregnated by their abusers, had escaped captivity by Boko Haram only to become victims at the camps. The Borno State governor plans to deploy undercover detectives to the camps to bring the culprits to justice. Boko Haram is responsible for thousands of deaths and displacements in Nigeria.

"Sally Brampton, the founding editor of Elle magazine in the UK, took her own life after health professionals failed to offer her help, according to an inquest. Brampton, who had a long battle with depression, drowned after walking into the sea near her home. She had sought help from a psychiatrist and GP but did not receive the assistance she needed. Two months prior to her death, she had been referred to mental health services but was not offered any help. The inquest revealed that crucial information about her condition had not been provided to the relevant services. The coroner concluded that there were missed opportunities to help Brampton, but it is uncertain if they would have changed the outcome. The mental health services have since made changes and no longer use faxes. Brampton was a respected journalist and author, known for her book ""Shoot the Damn Dog"" about her battle with depression."

Management and ownership at a Saskatoon dog kennel were warned about multiple serious problems with their animal care methods before the death of 14 large breed dogs. The kennel was warned about ventilation problems, among other issues, by a certified master trainer and kennel care expert. The SPCA also received a copy of the complaints but is unable to pursue them due to lack of power. The dogs died of heat exhaustion after a malfunction in the building's heating system caused the room they were in to become excessively hot. The kennel manager expressed remorse and stated that the upper-floor room where the deaths occurred has been closed off. The kennel will remain open. The kennel had previously received positive reviews from customers, but the trainer who raised concerns said that customers don't see the full picture. The trainer quit after management refused his suggestions and took his list of concerns to the SPCA. The SPCA is part of a coalition urging the provincial Ministry of Agriculture to reform legislation to better protect animals.

Springer is working on an audacious plan to spray poison pellets from helicopters to kill the mice, but the operation is challenging and expensive. A campaign is underway to raise funds for the eradication project. If successful, the plan will save the seabirds and allow a new generation of albatrosses to thrive.

Conversion therapy is a set of practices aimed at changing a person's sexuality or gender identity to fit heterosexual or cisgender norms. It is often religiously motivated and can include methods such as talk therapy, electroshock therapy, and aversion therapy. A survivor of conversion therapy, TC, shared his experience of being subjected to these practices, including harassment and physical abuse. Conversion therapy has been linked to serious harm, including increased rates of suicide and mental health issues among LGBTQ individuals. While mainstream psychiatric organizations do not support conversion therapy, it is still promoted in some circles. Only five states and the District of Columbia have laws protecting LGBTQ youth from being forced into conversion therapy. TC, who escaped conversion therapy, emphasizes the need to recognize the harm caused by these practices and to treat LGBTQ individuals with dignity and respect.

Experts believe that the actual number of hate crimes is likely higher than reported, and they expect the situation to worsen due to the mainstreaming of Islamophobia by Trump.

Well, knowing how you love your coffee just as much as I do, I just knew this would fascinate you! Tell everyone!!	A report commissioned by Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand warns that climate change poses a significant threat to the world's coffee supply. The report highlights the impact of warming temperatures on farmland, which will reduce the global area suitable for coffee by about 50%. It also emphasizes the increased risk of diseases and pests, such as coffee rust and the coffee berry borer. Major coffee companies have been aware of these threats for years and have been implementing support programs for coffee growers. However, the report suggests that no single company is large enough to tackle the challenge of climate change on its own. The World Coffee Research group is developing adaptive strategies to address the issue, including preserving genetic diversity, creating a variety catalog, and evaluating new coffee varieties. Despite these efforts, there are still major gaps in knowledge on how to best help coffee producers adapt to climate change. The report raises concerns about the livelihoods of the 125 million people worldwide who depend on coffee, particularly those in developing countries.

Kenyan authorities have reacted super angrily to a U.N. decision this week to dismiss the Kenyan general in charge of the peacekeeping force there, for failing to protect civilians during a recent outbreak of violence.	The Kenyan government has deported a senior South Sudan opposition member, James Gatdet Dak, despite threats against him. This comes after the UN dismissed the Kenyan general in charge of the peacekeeping force in South Sudan for failing to protect civilians during recent violence. Dak, a spokesman for the main South Sudanese rebel group, expressed support for the removal of the Kenyan top officer in the UN mission in South Sudan in a Facebook post. The conflict in South Sudan has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and displacement of hundreds of thousands. Human rights experts warn that Dak is at risk in South Sudan. Kenya has threatened to withdraw its peacekeeping troops from South Sudan following the dismissal of their general. The row between the UN and the Kenyan government highlights the tense relations between the two.
313	6.2	6.0	Hello again! Writing to share some things I have been learning about. I read that  Syrians and Iraqis are granted asylum in Germany far more often than Pakistanis, and Nigerians. Germany is confronting the task of deciding who gets to stay. If you’re from Syria or Iraq, sanctuary is almost guaranteed. But if you’re from Nigeria or Pakistan, chances are you journeyed all the way there for nothing.

But if you’re from Nigeria or Pakistan, chances are you journeyed all the way there for nothing. This is so distressing!	Germany, which took in more asylum seekers than the rest of Europe combined, is facing the challenge of deciding who gets to stay. Syrians and Iraqis are almost guaranteed sanctuary, while Nigerians and Pakistanis are more likely to have their claims rejected. Even Syrians are increasingly falling short of winning full refugee status. Critics argue that asylum officials are turning a deaf ear to genuine petitions from asylum seekers arriving from countries outside the Middle East war zones. The German government is increasingly targeting migrants deemed ineligible for protection and is enforcing deportation more strictly. The system is flawed, with many appeals against the Federal Office's decisions and concerns about inexperienced decision-makers and declining interpreter quality.

Hi, I have learned that Syria’s war escalated abruptly on Friday. Government forces and their Russian allies launched ferocious aerial assaults on Aleppo. Repeated airstrikes destroyed buildings and engulfed neighborhoods, and flames killed about 100 people there. What is gained with this senseless violence?	The war in Syria escalated as government forces and their Russian allies launched intense aerial assaults on opposition-held areas of Aleppo. The bombings killed about 100 people and knocked out running water for two million people. Efforts at the United Nations to revive a cease-fire collapsed, and hopes for humanitarian relief faded. The bombings left residents buried in debris and turned neighborhoods into rubble. The Syrian government announced a new offensive, including a ground operation, but analysts doubt their ability to seize and hold significant territory. Diplomatic efforts between Russia and the United States also disintegrated. The situation in Aleppo continues to worsen, with no end in sight.

They will not be able to out swim the things that will b more of a chance at getting them because of whats happening right now. We have to help save the polar bears. Its been pretty terrible how the goverment and companoes just dont care to help save these animals.	A new study from the University of Washington, funded by NASA and other agencies, reveals that all 19 polar bear populations across the Arctic are facing a shorter sea ice season. The study, which is the first to quantify the sea ice changes in each polar bear subpopulation, shows a trend towards earlier sea ice melt in the spring and later ice growth in the fall. These changes negatively impact the feeding and breeding capabilities of the bears, as they rely on the sea ice for essential activities such as hunting and traveling. The study also found that the critical timing of the sea ice break-up and freeze-up is changing in all areas, which is harmful for polar bears. The researchers recommend that the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance be incorporated as measures of climate change in future reports.

Since Donald Trump's election, there have been over 200 acts of election-related intimidation and harassment in the US, targeting marginalized groups such as black, Latino, Muslim, Jewish, Asian, queer people, and women. These acts include physical harm, hate speech, and racist graffiti. Trump supporters feel empowered to express their disdain for those they dislike or deem insignificant. It is crucial for America to stand united against these attacks and promote a message of intolerance towards hate.

Members of the band Eagles of Death Metal, who were playing at the Bataclan concert hall during the Paris Attacks, attended a memorial in Paris to honor the 130 people killed in the coordinated terrorist attacks. The band's frontman, Jesse Hughes, praised the city's response to the tragedy. Sting performed the first show at the Bataclan since the attacks, but Hughes was not allowed to enter due to his previous comments about Muslim security personnel collaborating with the attackers. Hughes later apologized for his statement. At the memorial, Hughes expressed his gratitude to the people of France. Sting's performance included a moment of silence and a statement in French to remember the victims and celebrate the venue's history.

Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans took to the streets in Seoul for the second consecutive weekend, demanding the resignation of President Park Geun-hye. The protests were sparked by Park's admission that she shared classified information with someone lacking security clearance. The demonstrations, which included families, students, and union members, were some of the largest anti-government protests in decades. Four officers and 26 protesters were injured during the protests. Park's spokesman stated that she realizes the seriousness of the situation and is considering ways to normalize affairs. Protesters are calling for Park's resignation due to feelings of betrayal and frustration with her leadership. The protests also stem from other incidents, such as the Sewol ferry sinking. Despite roadblocks, protesters attempted to march to the presidential palace. The demonstrations will continue until there are answers and a resolution to the political turmoil.

A study from the University of Copenhagen has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study, which tracked one million Danish women for 13 years, found that women taking the combined oral contraceptive were 23% more likely to be diagnosed with depression, while those using progestin-only pills were 34% more likely. Teens were at the greatest risk, with an 80% increase in depression when taking the combined pill. Other hormone-based methods, such as the hormonal IUS/coil, the patch, and the ring, were shown to increase depression at a higher rate than oral contraceptives. The study suggests that the practice of encouraging teens to use these alternatives to the pill is misguided. The medical community's response to the study has been dismissive, with experts downplaying the link and offering paternalistic advice. The burden of avoiding unwanted pregnancy falls on women, despite the potential negative effects on their health and wellbeing. Effective alternatives to hormonal contraceptives exist, but they are often overlooked. It is important to remember that women are twice as likely to experience depression as men, and blaming women's depression on their biological femaleness is acceptable, but blaming medication formulated from synthetic hormones is not. The study's authors plan to research the possible association between hormonal birth control and suicide attempts or completions. While not every woman experiences depression and anxiety from hormonal contraceptives, it is important to acknowledge that many do, and their lives could be improved by recognizing and addressing this issue.

Egyptian authorities have recovered 162 bodies from a sunken migrant boat in the Mediterranean, with the death toll expected to rise to nearly 300. The boat capsized off the coast of Rosetta, carrying an estimated 450 people, mostly young Egyptian men. The number of Egyptians attempting to cross to Europe has risen sharply in the last two years, due to economic pressure and a possible shift away from Libya as a departure point. Meanwhile, China and other Asian countries are under pressure to shut down tiger farms, which supply the black market with skins, bones, and other parts. The Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has voted to ban international trade in pangolins, the most trafficked mammal on Earth. The ban aims to protect all eight species of Asian and African pangolins, which are hunted for their scales and meat. A wildfire in California's Santa Cruz Mountains has threatened hundreds of structures, with nearly 1,100 firefighters working to protect homes and communication towers. Cooler weather conditions are expected to help contain the fire.

Rescue teams are working to save more people trapped in the rubble of a collapsed 10-storey building in Kisii Town. The death toll currently stands at nine, with hopes of finding more survivors. The rescue efforts are being coordinated by the Kenya Defence Forces, Kenya Red Cross, and St-John Ambulance personnel. It is suspected that drilling underneath the building may have caused its collapse. The developer of the building is currently in hiding, and authorities are urging him to surrender for investigation. The blame game between the county and national governments has been criticized, with the focus being on rescue operations. Efforts are being made to save those still trapped, with additional tools and machinery ordered. The NCA is assessing adjacent buildings for safety, as they pose a danger to the rescue operations. All buildings in Kisii Town will be assessed to ensure their safety, and contractors are warned against violating construction procedures. This is the second incident this year, following the collapse in Huruma, Nairobi County. The developer of the Kisii building is being blamed for ignoring NCA warnings.

Ryan Collins, a man from Pennsylvania, has been sentenced to 18 months in jail for hacking into the accounts of celebrities and stealing nude photos and videos. He pleaded guilty to the charges and had stolen the usernames and passwords of over 600 people, including Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Scarlett Johansson, and Kirsten Dunst. Collins tricked his victims by sending emails that appeared to be from Google or Apple. Although he accessed the photos between 2012 and 2014, he was not charged with releasing them. Prosecutors have found no evidence linking Collins to the leaks or sharing the obtained information. He accessed at least 50 iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts using fraudulent email addresses. Collins was originally charged in Los Angeles but was sentenced in Pennsylvania, his home state.

I mean, we generally go out of our way to not blow up the nearby children's hospital, but the second we suspect Bin Laden's cousin is in there 7000 drones start swarming.	The UN reports that tens of thousands of civilians have been abducted by ISIS in Mosul and used as human shields. The group has also killed former security service members and civilians who refused to obey their orders. Iraqi, Kurdish, and allied forces are advancing to retake Mosul, but there are concerns that ISIS will use the remaining 1.5 million people in the city to defend themselves. Reports suggest that civilians have been forced from their homes and relocated inside the city since the offensive began. ISIS is preventing families from fleeing to territory held by the Iraqi army and targeting those suspected of disloyalty.

The Democratic Party suffered a shocking defeat in the recent election, with Donald Trump winning key demographics that were expected to support Democrats. Many Obama voters flipped to Trump, and he outperformed Romney among union households, whites without a college degree, and low-income households. The success of Obama's coalition may have been due to his unique talent as a politician, rather than a stable majority. The Democratic Party is now facing a struggle for dominance between Sanders supporters and the establishment wing. With no legislative victories in sight and upcoming electoral losses, the party's future is uncertain. Economic insecurity may have contributed to the rise of racism and far-right political parties. To prevent the views that led to Trump's victory, Democrats need to focus on delivering economic gains to working people.

The Pilcomayo River in Paraguay is experiencing an extensive die-off of caiman, fish, and other river creatures due to a combination of drought and mismanagement. Up to 98% of caimans and 80% of capybaras are suspected dead. The river has dried up for nearly 435 miles and the government has declared an environmental emergency. The mismanagement of water resources and infrastructure by both Paraguay and Argentina has exacerbated the crisis. The river's wandering behavior and the significant amount of sediment it transports downstream have contributed to the blockage and dispersal of the river outside its channel. The government is working to find a solution, but there is no water to release or divert. Zimbabwe plans to sell its wildlife, including elephants and possibly endangered African wild dogs, to replenish its coffers due to cash shortages and a drought. Critics argue that the mismanagement of the economy and lack of accountability make this plan unworkable. South Australia has been hit by a destructive storm just 24 hours after a super cell thunderstorm knocked out the state's entire power network.

The Confederate battle flag, a divisive symbol, has resurfaced in the context of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign and his supporters. The flag has been displayed at Trump rallies and used as a response to anti-Trump protests. The flag's resurgence raises questions about race relations under Trump and the influence of his campaign on white resentment and white nationalism. Historians note that the flag has had shifting meanings over time, representing white resistance to integration during the Civil Rights era and now symbolizing concerns about the displacement of white culture. While some Trump supporters argue that the flag represents heritage, others acknowledge that it has been hijacked by hate groups. Reports of discrimination and hate crimes targeting minorities have increased since the election, with many incidents invoking Trump and his campaign slogans. The flag's new context is perplexing to some Southerners who view it as a symbol of Southern sacrifice rather than a political statement.

American refineries processed over 230,000 barrels of Amazon crude oil per day last year, with California alone refining an average of 170,978 barrels per day. The expansion of oil drilling in the Amazon poses a serious threat to the region, with proposed oil and gas fields covering an area larger than Texas. The destruction of the Amazon rainforest releases greenhouse gases and puts indigenous communities and biodiversity at risk. Ecuador's state oil company recently started drilling near the biologically rich Yasuni national park. Indigenous communities are at risk of pollution, displacement, and deadly illnesses. Amazon Watch is calling for a reduction in Amazon crude imports and the establishment of ""no go zones"" in decision making."

Indigenous communities in Labrador, Canada are protesting the construction of a hydroelectric dam due to concerns about the release of methylmercury into Lake Melville, which would contaminate their food sources. A study from Harvard's environmental scientist, Elsie Sunderland, predicts that the dam will expose communities to double the amount of methylmercury they currently ingest, potentially causing acute poisoning. The dam's developer, Nalcor Energy, acknowledges that methylmercury levels will spike but claims they will eventually return to pre-dam levels. However, Sunderland's study contradicts this claim. The study also highlights that other hydroelectric projects in Canada pose similar risks to indigenous populations. Indigenous leaders and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador have reached a compromise to address the methylmercury impact, but specific measures have not been determined yet.

"The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, was known to the FBI for years but was not considered a security threat. This highlights the challenge of identifying ""lone wolf"" terrorists who are not connected to established extremist groups. The FBI retains data on individuals even after determining they are not a threat, raising concerns about privacy rights. The shooting has sparked debate about whether individuals interviewed by the FBI should be able to purchase guns or be under continued surveillance. The FBI interviewed Mateen multiple times but was unable to find any suspicious ties. The bureau is allowed to keep data on individuals even after closing investigations, which has raised concerns about privacy. Trust between local communities and the government is crucial in identifying domestic lone-wolf extremists before they commit acts of terrorism. The difficulty in identifying individuals like Mateen highlights the lack of a profile for potential terrorists."

Hey, this is one reason I don't get on rides at amusement parks anymore. They are not reliable and they freak me out thinking that they are going to break.

Four people were killed in a river ride malfunction at Dreamworld, Australia's largest theme park. The incident occurred on the Thunder River Rapids Ride, a popular attraction that is considered tame and family-friendly. Two people were ejected from the raft, while the other two were trapped inside. The victims' identities have not been released, and authorities have not provided details about the injuries sustained. Witnesses reported seeing the ride flip and a girl being pulled from it before it overturned. Emergency services were unable to save the victims, and the park was closed for the day. The incident has deeply affected the staff and prompted an investigation by multiple agencies.

The quoted official mentioned that dry conditions meant more fires could easily be accidentally started and that was a danger.	A prolonged drought in the southeast U.S. has led to numerous forest fires in the southern Appalachian Mountains. These fires have burned over 107,000 acres, with 37 fires covering at least 100 acres each. Arson is suspected in some cases. The fires have caused a hazy pall over northern Georgia, and officials have warned of unhealthy air quality. State firefighters are working to contain the fires and have urged people to avoid starting new ones. The drought has also affected water levels, with a popular state park's main attraction reduced to a trickle.

The ISIS fighters were certainly brutal towards their victims, and have captured many more to use as human shields or to kill outright for their perceived beliefs.	A mass grave containing bodies showing evidence of torture by the Islamic State (ISIS) was discovered near Mosul, Iraq. The exact number of bodies and cause of death is unknown, but investigators believe that many more burial sites will be found as Iraqi forces continue to retake territory from ISIS. The bodies found in this grave had been dumped on piles of trash, with some showing signs of being bound and blindfolded. Locals reported that ISIS fighters had been rounding up former members of Iraqi security forces in the area. A UN human rights organization stated that ISIS recently abducted 295 former Iraqi security forces members and forced 1,500 families to retreat with them to the Mosul airport, potentially using them as human shields.

The article mentioned that birth control for women revolutionized lives so much that the side effects were deemed acceptable, but men are not accustomed to ceding convenience for responsibility, are used to women taking control in this area.	Scientists have been working on developing birth control for men, and a recent clinical trial showed promising results. However, the trial was discontinued due to side effects such as mood changes, depression, pain at the injection site, and increased libido. The article highlights the side effects of various birth control options for women, which are equally as bad but have not been halted. Women have always borne the burden of birth control, and the article argues that men should share in the responsibility. The availability of birth control has been revolutionary for women, leading to wage gains, increased college enrollment, and a decline in teen pregnancies. The article points out the double standard in the standards for male and female birth control, with women being expected to endure more side effects. The article concludes by highlighting the hypocrisy that women face in exchange for reproductive freedom.

Gay rights protesters were rounded up by police and taken away from the resort where they were protesting and of those that attempted to resume protesting at another spot, police escorted them away. Gay rights have been struggling in Uganda, where homosexuality is illegal and repressed.	Ugandan police have blocked a gay pride parade in two resorts near Kampala. More than 100 LGBTI people attempted to participate in the celebrations, but were escorted back to Kampala by police. The minister for ethics and integrity had threatened to mobilize mobs against participants. Homosexuality is illegal in Uganda. This is the second time the LGBTI community has tried to hold gay pride celebrations this year, with the previous attempt resulting in arrests. The reason for the targeting of this event is unclear, as previous celebrations have gone unnoticed by the police. In 2014, a bill to further criminalize homosexuality was overturned in court.

It is odd that an elephant can literally walk away from its protection by wandering into the neighboring country. I was not aware of any of this. The article somewhat jokingly said that elephants do not have passports.	At a global wildlife summit, a bid to provide the highest level of international legal protection to all African elephants was defeated. However, new measures were passed to add vital protection for elephants, including the closure of legal ivory markets within nations and tougher measures to deal with nations failing to control poached ivory. The debate over elephant poaching has divided African countries, with some arguing that making money from ivory sales and trophy hunting is necessary for protection, while others believe that poaching and the illegal ivory trade pose the greatest threat. Most African elephants already have the highest level of international legal protection, but elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Botswana have a lower level of protection. A proposal to upgrade these populations to the highest level of protection was defeated. The EU and some scientific and conservation groups opposed the upgrade, arguing that it did not meet the biological criteria. The issue of cutting the demand for ivory and better enforcement against poachers were highlighted as key solutions.

Hate crimes against Muslims in the United States reached their highest level since 2001, with a 67% increase in anti-Islamic incidents in 2015 compared to the previous year. Experts and advocates attribute this rise to anger over terrorist attacks and anti-Islam rhetoric during the presidential campaign. The Council on American-Islamic Relations blames the mainstreaming of Islamophobia by public figures like Donald Trump for the increase in hate crimes. Overall hate crimes increased by 6.7% in 2015, with anti-black, anti-Jewish, and anti-sexual orientation incidents also rising. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported 201 incidents of election-related harassment and intimidation, and there were reports of hateful acts before and after Trump's election. The data is limited as many law enforcement agencies do not report hate crimes voluntarily. Analysts believe that the spike in hate crimes against Muslims is due to anger after terrorist attacks, prejudice against Muslims, and the labeling of Muslims as enemies. The professor who wrote about the surge in crimes against Muslims expects that the levels of hate crimes in 2016 are either at or above those of 2015.

Actress Susan Sarandon has launched an online petition urging people to empty their bank accounts in protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

The petition asks signatories to withdraw their money and place it in credit unions until the banks divest and pressure the White House for an environmental impact statement.

A palm oil company named PT Mohairson Pawan Khatulistiwa plans to clear more than half of the Sungai Putri forest in Indonesia, which is home to a critically endangered orangutan population. Despite the Indonesian government's commitment to protecting peat, forests, and orangutans, the company has been granted a license to destroy the forest. The forest is at risk of being converted into an industrial tree plantation, and the company has already started work on building a drainage canal. The destruction of the forest and the orangutans' habitat is incompatible with Indonesia's national action plan for orangutans. The development violates Indonesia's legal processes and international commitments. Improved management is needed in Sungai Putri to address illegal logging and fires. There are conflicting opinions on the deforestation, with some supporting it for potential employment opportunities and compensation, while others argue that it is unsustainable. Alternative solutions that involve collaboration between various stakeholders are available to fulfill development objectives and alleviate poverty in Indonesia.

The battle against the Islamic State has resulted in soldiers and civilians being injured or killed by chlorine gas, mortar fire, bombs, and artillery shells. The presence of civilians in the city has made the fight more difficult for Iraqi forces and airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition. The Islamic State has been using civilians as human shields, preventing them from leaving the city. The medical station on the outskirts of Mosul is treating injured civilians, but many are unable to reach medical assistance. The fight for Mosul is expected to be prolonged, putting more civilians at risk. The Iraqi military does not release overall casualty figures, but the toll is likely much higher than reported. The battle has also caused food shortages, forcing some residents to flee. The situation is dire, with injured children and desperate pleas for help.

The incident has reignited scrutiny of the police department, which previously faced controversy over the shooting of an unarmed black man. This shooting is the latest in a series of incidents that have sparked outrage and debate about race relations and law enforcement. The police department is currently conducting an investigation into the shooting.

Turkey’s parliament voted to strip lawmakers of their immunity	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has escalated his conflict with the Kurdish opposition by arresting at least eight members of parliament from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), including the party's two leaders. The arrests have been criticized as an assault on Turkey's democracy and have drawn condemnations from European capitals and the United Nations. The crackdown on political opponents follows a failed coup attempt in July, with tens of thousands of people being arrested or dismissed from their jobs. The government has also been targeting Kurdish opposition politicians, linking them to Kurdish militant groups. The arrests of HDP lawmakers are seen as a turning point in the government's campaign of arrests and have raised fears of greater instability in the country.

The large Somali community in Minneapolis went through a rigorous screening process to enter the US, but younger generations are struggling to earn a living. Donald Trump's anti-immigrant stance is based on a false notion that the country's safety is at risk from Muslim extremists due to lax vetting policies. In reality, refugees face a lengthy screening process by the United Nations before coming to the US. However, once in the country, they receive limited support in terms of job-search help and cash assistance, making it difficult for them to integrate into the American economy. This lack of support contributes to refugee families' difficulty in escaping poverty and younger generations' sense of isolation.

Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, was remembered at a funeral service in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The service drew hundreds of mourners and highlighted concerns about biased policing in the United States. The funeral came a day after the police officer who shot Crutcher was booked on a first degree manslaughter charge. Videos released by the police show Crutcher with his hands in the air before being shot. Speakers at the funeral described Crutcher as a father of four with a good heart. The service took place after a rally organized by Black Lives Matter and other groups.

Microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by malformed heads and stunted brain development, has been linked to the Zika virus. The severity of microcephaly can vary, but it often results in mental impairment. Detecting the condition before birth is difficult, leading to debates about abortion. Raising a child with microcephaly requires extensive care and support, which can be costly. Early intervention programs can help, but they often end after three years. The CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics have published guidelines for evaluating and caring for infants with Zika-related microcephaly. The cost of care for each child is estimated to be $10 million over a lifetime. Families with resources, like the Grounds family, can provide the best care for their child, but many others struggle. Nicholas, a child with microcephaly, has made progress with intensive intervention, but ongoing support is necessary. Parents of children with microcephaly need support throughout their lives. Genetic testing revealed that Nicholas inherited two mutated genes from his parents, causing microcephaly. The odds of their second child having the condition were one in four.

A recent article in the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta has sparked a national debate in Russia about the role of social media in promoting suicide among young people. The article claims that Russia's most popular social network, VKontakte (VK), has numerous groups that encourage vulnerable young people to kill themselves. The article alleges that at least 80 recent suicides can be linked to these online groups. Critics have accused the article of sensationalism and placing too much emphasis on the internet as a cause of juvenile suicide. However, the article has also prompted law enforcement agencies to launch a criminal case over groups on VK that allegedly promote suicide. Russia has one of the highest rates of youth suicide in the world, and the article has brought much-needed attention to this serious issue.

A British tourist who claimed she was raped in Dubai is now facing charges of extramarital sex. The woman, 25, reported being attacked by two U.K. men last month, but instead of being treated as a victim, she was locked up and charged. She is currently on bail but cannot leave the country and needs $30,000 for legal fees. The men have returned to Birmingham, while the woman fears a long jail term for violating the United Arab Emirates' Sharia laws on sex. Her passport has been taken, and she is staying with an English family. The incident occurred during her dream adventure after leaving her IT consultancy career. The victim's family claims that the men took turns raping her while filming the assault. In the UAE, sex outside marriage is prohibited for couples, and single individuals are forbidden from having sex with married individuals. The victim's marital status is unclear.

The suspect, who appeared to die from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, knew the victim's schedule and routine. The airport was closed and flights were canceled or diverted while police investigated. The airport has high security, but it is unclear if surveillance cameras captured the shooting. The victim, Michael Winchester, was a ramp supervisor for Southwest Airlines. He was described as a former student athlete at the University of Oklahoma, and his son currently plays for the Kansas City Chiefs.

These schools punished students for speaking their native languages or observing indigenous traditions, and subjected them to physical and sexual assault, medical experimentation, and sterilization. Photographer Daniella Zalcman's book, Signs of Your Identity, documents the lasting effects of this trauma through double exposure portraits of former students and related places or items. The system caused the death of at least 6,000 children, and the last Indian Residential School closed in 1996. The government issued its first apology in 2008.

Those who refuse to comply are shot, while others are taken but manage to escape. The militants are also executing former policemen and army officers out of paranoia. This tactic of holding civilians hostage complicates the U.S.-led airstrikes and puts civilians at risk of being caught in crossfire.

The damage has already been done, and the global average temperature of 2015 will be the norm by 2040. Extreme seasons will become the norm within decades if emissions continue as usual. However, there is still hope to prevent record-breaking heat at a seasonal and regional level with immediate action on carbon emissions. The Paris climate agreement's proposed emissions cuts are not enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. To keep global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius, emissions need to be slashed by an additional 25 percent by 2030. Despite concerns about President-elect Donald Trump's stance on climate change, world leaders and activists remain committed to battling climate change."

Two soldiers were killed by attackers armed with guns, knives, and spears. In retaliation, the government used helicopters to fire at the attackers. The area is closed to Western journalists, making it difficult to verify the scale of the fighting. The Rohingya have been under siege since the government sent security forces to hunt for armed Rohingya assailants who had killed nine police officers. Human rights groups have received reports of killings, rapes, and beatings of Rohingya civilians. Western diplomats have called for an independent investigation into the violence, but Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has declined. The Rohingya population has been subjected to decades of repression, making them susceptible to radicalization. The government's harsh proposals may have been the catalyst for the recent attacks. The Rohingya villages have become armed camps, with reports of food scarcity, curfews, and rape by soldiers. Myanmar officials deny the occurrence of rapes.

I mean, I did drop out but only after 30 years of employment.  It seems as if, in this day and age, you'd hear that women's participation in the workforce had increased, not decreased.	The World Economic Forum (WEF) released its annual global gender gap report, revealing that the US has slipped to 45th place in terms of gender equality. This decline is attributed to a decrease in women's participation in the labor force and a shrinking number of women in senior positions. However, the US has closed its education gender gap. Globally, progress towards economic equality has slowed, with the gender pay gap persisting and women's labor force participation lower than men's. The report warns that the global economic gender gap is not expected to close until 2196. The lack of progress in economic equality is concerning, as jobs typically held by women are at risk due to technological disruption. The top-ranking countries in terms of gender equality are predominantly Scandinavian. The Global Gender Gap Index ranks countries based on the distribution of resources between men and women.

The presence of naturally occurring arsenic in shallow groundwater further exacerbates the problem. The pumping is causing faster groundwater flow, which can transport contaminants like arsenic to deeper areas of the aquifer, even outside the city limits. This poses a threat to deep wells used for arsenic mitigation in these areas. The researchers used detailed subsurface measurements to model the geology of Dhaka and found that strong pumping and heterogeneity in the underground sediments affect the hydrology of the area. Heterogeneity refers to the way sand and clay are oriented underground and is critical to how contaminants move in groundwater. In a delta system like Bangladesh, the clay layers are chopped up, allowing water to move in unpredictable ways and creating uncertainty about well contamination. The researchers theorize that if pumping continues at current levels, some wells outside the city center could become contaminated sooner than expected. The low water levels caused by pumping could also compromise the operation of handpumps in these areas. Arsenic is tasteless, odorless, and colorless, making it difficult for communities to detect its presence in water without testing. The researchers' models showed that typical hydrogeological data used to assess well safety is not predictive in this type of heterogeneous system. This highlights the need for water quality monitoring and the development of artificial groundwater recharge methods to address the water crisis in the region.

The British Government is supporting an oil drilling project in Uganda's Murchison Falls National Park, which poses a significant risk to the endangered Rothschild giraffe species. The project involves drilling multiple wells in the park, which is home to one of the last remaining populations of these giraffes. Leaked documents reveal that the British oil company, Tullow Oil, has been in talks with the government to provide taxpayer-backed loans and insurance for the project. Conservationists have been relocating giraffes away from the drilling sites to protect them. Greenpeace UK criticizes the government's support for the project and urges them to focus on sustainable energy sources instead. Tullow Oil claims to have committed to protecting the Rothschild giraffe during the development.

Granted I agree lead is bad but then again some Govt. clown probably needs to do something to justify the 6 figure income they make.	Chicago has shut down hundreds of public drinking fountains due to excessive levels of lead in the water. The ongoing crisis in Flint, Michigan has prompted other communities to test for lead, including the Chicago Park District. Testing revealed that nearly a quarter of outdoor fountains and 14 indoor fountains and sinks exceeded the federal standard for lead levels. Some fountains had lead levels 80 times higher than the permissible level. All fountains and sinks with high lead levels have been disabled and will undergo further testing and repairs. The lack of adequate testing for lead in public settings is a national problem, according to public health officials. Lead can have serious health effects, especially in young children, and there is no safe level of lead in the body. Lead pipes and fixtures are still common in communities across the country. While taking a sip from a single fountain may not seriously affect health, it can contribute to cumulative lead exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations like the homeless and children.

North Korea has experienced heavy flooding caused by Typhoon Lionrock, leading to an unusual appeal for help from the government. The flooding has caused significant destruction to homes, infrastructure, and power systems in the country's Northeastern Hamgyong province. At least 133 people have been killed and nearly 400 are missing. The government has redirected its loyalty campaign to assist those affected. This public admission of needing help is rare for North Korea. The international community is being called upon to respond to the disaster. This comes after North Korea's fifth nuclear test, which was met with international condemnation.

Jewish communities in the United States are grappling with fear, grief, and anger following Donald Trump's election as president. Synagogues across the country have held prayer and healing services to address these emotions. While Jews have not been directly insulted by Trump, they fear that his presidency will create a hostile environment for minority groups. The Jewish community is overwhelmingly liberal and Democratic, leading to a sense of alienation from their fellow Americans. However, they also recognize the need for understanding and reaching out to Trump supporters. Jews are urged to reflect on their own actions and allyship with other marginalized groups. This new era has brought about a struggle for Jews to understand Trump supporters while maintaining their own values and finding solidarity with others.

Nosey, a 34-year-old female African elephant, has been held captive and subjected to decades of abuse. She has been forced to live in solitary confinement, perform in circuses, and give rides to people. This has caused significant stress to her physical and psychological well-being. Nosey has spent most of her life in a small trailer, receiving little exercise and no socialization. She has developed arthritis due to her long-term confinement. Despite over 200 citations and 30 violations of the Animal Welfare Act by her owner, Hugo Tommy Liebel, the USDA has not taken action. Nosey is suffering from chronic, untreated health problems and lives in pain. The USDA has the power and responsibility to respond to citizen complaints and confiscate Nosey, releasing her into a proper elephant sanctuary. Immediate action is needed to end the daily abuse of this animal.

Leon Russell, a musician known for his dynamic performances, has died at the age of 74. He emerged in the 1970s as a prominent rock 'n' roll performer and songwriter after working as a studio pianist in the 1960s. Russell's health had been declining in recent years, and he had undergone surgery and suffered a heart attack. However, he had plans to return to the road in January. Russell's period of stardom was relatively short, but he experienced a comeback in 2010 when he collaborated with Elton John on an album. Russell recorded numerous albums and was also a successful songwriter for other artists. He was known for his unique image and energetic stage presence. Russell's last performance was in July 2016. He began his career as part of the Wrecking Crew, a group of studio musicians, and later became a star in his own right. Russell's collaboration with Elton John brought him back into the spotlight after a period of relative obscurity.

A judge declared a mistrial in the case of a white former police officer charged with murder in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black motorist during a traffic stop. The jury was deadlocked, with some leaning towards a conviction of voluntary manslaughter. The officer, Ray Tensing, shot Sam DuBose in the head after pulling him over for a missing license plate. Tensing testified that he feared for his life, but prosecutors argued that the evidence contradicted his story. The judge set a new hearing date to determine if the case will be retried. The DuBose family wants another trial and is disappointed with the jury's inability to reach a conclusion. The shooting has raised attention to how police deal with blacks. Legal experts say juries tend to give police officers the benefit of the doubt, but will convict if the actions were clearly unwarranted. The trial was conducted under heightened security due to the potential for unrest. The University of Cincinnati fired Tensing and reached a settlement with DuBose's family.

The shortage was caused by a leak in a pipeline that runs from Houston to New Jersey, resulting in over 300,000 gallons of gas being leaked. The states affected by the shortage include Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas. While prices have increased, they are still below $2.50 per gallon in many areas. The shortage has led to panic and frustration among drivers, with some gas stations completely running out of fuel.

Two divers, Patrick Peacock and Chris Rittenmeyer, were found dead in the Eagle's Nest cave dive area in Western Florida. They had gone diving with a third man who reported them missing. The bodies were found the next day in a dangerous area of the cave system. The cave is known for its allure and is a popular destination for experienced divers. However, it is also considered dangerous, and signs warn divers of the risks. The area had been off-limits for divers from 1999 to 2003. Only highly trained divers should attempt to dive there, as even skilled divers can be affected at dangerous depths. The cause of death has not been disclosed, and autopsy results are pending. Some people have called for the area to be closed again, while others argue that people should be allowed to dive there if they have the necessary training and experience. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission did not comment on whether the site might be closed.

Those that have are going to have a hard time in life.	The Zika virus has been known to scientists for decades, but it has only recently become a serious public health concern. The majority of infected individuals do not experience symptoms, making it difficult to test for. Pregnant women are particularly at risk, as the virus can cause birth defects. Zika primarily spreads through infected mosquitoes, but it can also be transmitted through sexual contact. There is currently no vaccine or treatment for Zika, but scientists are making progress in developing them. The virus is prevalent in many countries, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Zika was first discovered in monkeys in Uganda in 1947 and has since spread to various parts of the world. In the United States, there have been thousands of cases, with Puerto Rico being heavily affected. The CDC has issued travel warnings for Zika in many countries.

I feel like aside from clearly inhumane treatment, it should be expected that killing an animal for food isn't exactly going to be the most pleasant process for the creature.  I'm not particularly surprised that the method of stunning chickens has a failure rate.	Scientists have found that the method used by the U.S. poultry industry to stun chickens before slaughter does not consistently render them unconscious. This means that a significant number of chickens likely experience intense suffering when they are killed. The lack of regulations governing the humane slaughter of chickens in the U.S. has allowed poultry companies to prioritize meat quality over ensuring that chickens are reliably stunned. Animal protection groups are pressuring companies to phase out the use of electric water-baths and adopt alternative methods, such as controlled atmosphere killing. Gas stunning systems are considered more humane and produce better meat quality. The current process of slaughtering chickens also causes them stress and pain, with many experiencing broken bones and wing damage. The U.S. Agriculture Department estimates that hundreds of thousands of birds are unintentionally boiled alive each year. Animal welfare groups are campaigning to improve conditions for broiler chickens and some companies, like Perdue Farms, have pledged to install gas stunning systems in their facilities.

"Typhoon Meranti has caused damage in Taiwan and southeastern China, resulting in two deaths and dozens of injuries.

Meanwhile, across the US, trees are dying at an alarming rate due to climate change, drought, disease, insects, and wildfires. California has lost 66 million trees since 2010, primarily due to drought and pine beetles. The spread of ""Sudden Oak Death"" is also infecting various plants in northern California. The presence of dead trees poses a significant fire hazard. Furthermore, a study has found that household dust exposes people to toxic chemicals, with phthalates being the most commonly found. This exposure can lead to serious health problems, especially in children."

Aiden Webb, a 22-year-old rock climber from Norfolk, died while attempting to scale Vietnam's tallest mountain, Mount Fansipan. His body was found six days after he set off alone for the climb. His girlfriend, Bluebell Baughan, had pleaded with him to get help after he got lost on the mountain. Webb slipped, injured himself, and got lost off the main trail due to a landslide. He refused Baughan's pleas to call for help and had to spend the night dressed only in shorts. In his last text, he asked Baughan to raise the alarm, but the message failed to get through. His body was eventually found in a stream, and local police concluded that he had drowned while unconscious. The cause of his death could not be ascertained due to embalming. Webb's parents described him as a joy to be around and expressed their close bond as a family.

"Preliminary data released by the FBI show a 20% decrease in the number of police officers intentionally killed in the line of duty in 2015 compared to 2014. This contradicts the belief that increased criticism of police, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, has led to a ""war on cops."" However, the president of the national Fraternal Order of Police disagrees with the data and believes that officer deaths are increasing. The FBI data also reveal that instances of officers being killed in unprovoked or ambush attacks have remained steady for the past four years. The reasons for the decrease in officer deaths are unclear, but better training and policies are among the possible factors."

It's a sad situation, but if you read it, it was almost entirely the fault of man, and climate change only played a small part. The worst part is that it could have been prevented if somebody had sounded the alarm in time.	The Bramble Cay melomys, a reddish-brown rodent, recently made international news when it was declared extinct. While climate change played a role in its demise, human inaction was the ultimate cause. Rising sea levels due to climate change destroyed the melomys' habitat and food sources. However, it was revealed that Australian researchers had planned to start a captive breeding program for the melomys, but they were unable to find any individuals on Bramble Cay. This missed opportunity highlights the tragedy that had been unfolding for years. In a new paper, biologist John Woinarski and colleagues argue that the extinction of the melomys, along with two other Australian species, could have been prevented. The Christmas Island pipistrelle and Christmas Island forest skink also suffered from human neglect and inaction, allowing introduced predators to decimate their populations. Australia's biodiversity conservation law lacks explicit commitment to preventing human-caused extinctions, leaving species vulnerable. These extinctions are often overlooked due to the small size and remote locations of the species. Australia has the highest rate of mammal extinctions in the world, with 30 species lost since European colonization. Woinarski's assessment is driven by personal grief and a desire to learn from past mistakes. Australia still has over a thousand threatened and endangered species, and action is needed to prevent further extinctions. While climate change did contribute to the melomys' extinction, it is important to recognize the other environmental factors and the human choice to not save the species.

"Prominent Republican women are concerned that defending Donald Trump against accusations of sexual assault is damaging the party's relationship with female voters. Trump's comments about women have been a source of concern throughout his campaign, but the release of a 2005 video and subsequent allegations by 11 women have escalated the issue. Many male Republicans have come to Trump's defense, dismissing the accusers and potentially alienating female voters. This division within the party comes as polls show that women are supporting Hillary Clinton by a significant margin. Female Republican strategists and politicians, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Carly Fiorina, have distanced themselves from Trump. The recent interview between Newt Gingrich and Megyn Kelly further highlighted the party's struggle with women voters. Republican women are increasingly feeling that the party does not represent them and are critical of the party's handling of Trump's behavior. The GOP's treatment of women is playing into the ""war on women"" narrative that Democrats have pushed in the past. Trump's personal attacks on women, both in the media and on social media, have also contributed to the party's struggle with female voters. Overall, many Republican women believe that the party is not doing enough to address the concerns of female voters and that this will have negative consequences for the party in the general election."

Thousands of residents have fled the eastern neighborhoods of Mosul, the city held by the Islamic State, in the first significant wave of people escaping since the offensive to retake the city began two weeks ago. Over 1.2 million people are still believed to be trapped in Mosul, while newly constructed camps in the area can only accommodate 60,000 people. The fleeing residents, including shepherds with their herds of sheep, are heading towards a camp for displaced people on the banks of the Khazir River. Some of those who escaped were visibly relieved, removing their black veils and waving V for victory as Iraqi and Kurdish troops passed by. The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, released an audio recording calling on his followers to remain steadfast and fight. Iraqi commanders believe it is only a matter of time before the city is recaptured, but the fate of the civilians trapped inside remains uncertain. The number of civilians fleeing has significantly increased as fighting moves into more densely populated neighborhoods.

"Multiple studies show that Trump's sexist rhetoric can have a significant impact on thinking, stress, and self-esteem. Women have expressed feeling gross and objectified by his comments, and even trauma victims have been distressed by his behavior. Trump's defense that his words are ""just words"" or ""locker room talk"" does not render them harmless, as rude language can impair cognition and lead to less creative thinking. Uncivil political discourse, especially in a presidential debate, undermines trust in government and discourages women from running for office. Discriminatory speech has negative consequences for women, leading to anger, depression, and lower self-esteem. Different types of discrimination can compound each other, with women of color experiencing even greater harm. Trump's candidacy exposes the bleak state of gender relations in the US and raises questions about how sexism will be taken seriously in the future."

Let us support campaigns for the conservation of the environment and the use of renewable energy. The politicians only watch over the interests of the companies and not of the individuals.	375 top scientists, including 30 Nobel Prize winners, have published an open letter warning of the immediate and serious threat of climate change. They state that humans are causing climate change, with evidence of rising seas, warming oceans and atmosphere, melting ice, changing rainfall patterns, and increasing acidity in the ocean. The scientists criticize politicians and real estate developers without scientific experience who deny climate change. They express sadness that the Republican Party, historically supportive of environmental initiatives, is now rejecting climate science. The scientists emphasize the economic and social costs of inaction and call for rational decision-making to manage climate change risks. They also criticize the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, for wanting to scrap environmental agreements. The scientists highlight the success of renewable energy sources in reducing emissions and argue that action to reduce pollution does not harm the economy. They warn that voting for anti-science politicians will contribute to the climate change problem and urge voters to consider the conversation they will have with their children about their choices.

Climate change is already evident in all the ecosystems of the earth. the genes of living beings are changing in response to climate changes, affecting ecosystems around the world. the changes that by natural means should take a hundred of decades to occur, takes very few years to complete. This disorder affects the whole relationship of the ecosystems, discouraging them and causing their extinction.	A new study in Science reveals that global warming has already affected every aspect of life on Earth, from genes to entire ecosystems. With just a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, major impacts are already being felt in natural systems. More than 80% of ecological processes that support healthy marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems show signs of responses to climate change. These impacts have consequences for humans, including increased pests and disease outbreaks, unpredictable changes in fisheries, and decreasing agriculture yields. Understanding the adaptive capacity in nature can help address these issues and apply the same principles to crops, livestock, and aquacultural species. The study emphasizes the need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as there are already significant and widespread impacts from climate change across biological systems.

"Thousands of women in Iceland left work early to protest the gender wage gap. They gathered in Austurvollur square in Reykjavik, shouting ""Out"" to discrimination against women. The protest highlighted the 30% pay gap between men and women in Iceland. The demonstration aimed to bring attention to the issue and demand change. Despite Iceland's reputation as a gender-equal nation, progress on pay equity has been slow. The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap ranking shows that Iceland still has gaps in earned income and wages for similar work. The report also reveals that global progress towards economic parity between men and women has suffered setbacks in recent years. The gender pay gap persists due to various factors, including women entering less well-paid professions and the time it takes for employers' implicit gender biases to change. The protest in Iceland emphasizes the urgency of addressing the gender pay gap and the need for faster progress."

The closure will affect hundreds of thousands of students and over 8,000 employees. ITT blamed the closure on the actions and sanctions from the Department of Education, which barred the company from enrolling new students using federal financial aid. The company has been found to be out of compliance with accreditor standards twice this year. For-profit colleges like ITT Tech have been criticized for charging high tuition fees without providing a valuable education. Some students may be eligible to have their federal student loans discharged and transfer their credits to another institution.

This article is extremely sad for the State of Louisiana. Not only has the state been ravaged by floods leading to the damage of both homes and businesses, but now the economy is being further devastated by the exodus of individuals and population erosion from pre-Katrina years. The state needs an injection of capital to help individuals and small businesses get their feet back underneath them, and providing the foundation of the local economies to not only sustain themselves and thrive.	The flood-ravaged state of Louisiana may face a population loss as residents consider leaving after the flood waters recede. While few people have confirmed their departure, it is a topic of discussion among many. The state's economy will suffer if there is a decline in population, as it will reduce spending and tax revenue. Louisiana experienced a 6% population decrease after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, taking over five years to recover. Although this year's exodus is unlikely to be as severe, the shortage of available housing and the closure of small businesses due to the flooding pose challenges. Additionally, the decline in oil industry jobs and the state's high unemployment rate further complicate the situation. The aid and insurance money that typically accompanies natural disasters may not be enough to prevent people from leaving, exacerbating an already struggling economy.

These events show a vast contrast between both extremely hot weather and also extreme amounts of precipitation when compared across historical items. Showing it is not just a regionally focused weather pattern, but in fact across the country that is the most troubling.	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that the summer of 2016 in the United States was the 5th hottest on record, tied with 2006. The average temperature was 73.5 degrees Fahrenheit, which was 2.1 degrees above average. Every state in the continental US, including Alaska, experienced above-average temperatures. Precipitation also broke records, with a season total of 0.60 inch above average, making it the 24th wettest on record. In August, the US experienced the 17th warmest month on record, with an average temperature of 73.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The year-to-date average temperature for the contiguous US was the 3rd warmest on record. Several states, including Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, had record warm Augusts. California had its warmest summer on record, contributing to an active wildfire season. Alaska experienced its third warmest August, second warmest summer, and record warmth for the year. Louisiana also experienced record flooding in mid-August due to a storm system that dropped over 30 inches of rain.

This article shows the unfortunate process after animals are confiscated and taken away from these dangerous people, but there is no global consensus on the proper sequence and handling of these animals.	The world's wildlife trade policy body, CITES, is calling for better treatment and tracking of illegally traded animals that are confiscated by authorities. Between 2010 and 2014, over 60,000 wild creatures were seized, with a fifth of them being threatened species. However, wildlife advocates argue that animals often suffer after being confiscated, as they are sometimes sent to inadequate facilities, returned to traffickers, or released back into the wild where they can spread diseases. CITES guidelines state that confiscated animals should be sent back to the exporting country, a designated rescue center, or other appropriate places, with humane treatment ensured. However, this doesn't always happen due to cost, impracticality, or lack of designated rescue centers. CITES member countries have agreed to distribute a questionnaire to gather information on how nations deal with confiscated animals, and Humane Society International has offered recommendations on setting up rescue centers.

Experts have different opinions on how long it will stick around and how often it will return. Some believe it will behave like other arboviruses, recurring regularly with upticks in cases during the rainy season. Others predict that it will vanish in a few years, similar to chikungunya. The current outbreak in the Americas is due to the fact that people in the region had no immunity to the virus. Future outbreaks may be smaller if people develop immunity, but there could also be long lulls between outbreaks, allowing for a buildup of younger people who aren't immune. It is unclear if there will be fewer cases of microcephaly in the future due to the immunity gained from Zika infections. The impact of mosquito control efforts on young girls getting infected is also uncertain. It is unknown if Zika will strike Africa and Asia with the same ferocity as the Americas, but experts believe the two strains of Zika will be cross-protective. The uncertainty surrounding Zika's future affects the prospects for a vaccine. If Zika activity subsides, it will be difficult to conduct clinical trials to prove the vaccine's effectiveness. However, the fear of the virus's impact on developing fetuses may continue to drive demand for a vaccine.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man responsible for the bombings in Manhattan and on the Jersey Shore, had been planning the attacks for months and was inspired by international terrorists, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The complaint details the extent of the damage caused by the bombs, including shattered windows and victims with ball bearings and metal fragments in their bodies. It was also revealed that Rahami's father had previously expressed concerns to the authorities about his son's potential involvement in terrorism, but no further action was taken. Rahami's notebook, recovered after he was shot and wounded by the police, contained writings expressing his extremist Islamic ideology and admiration for terrorist figures. The complaint also mentions that Rahami had been acquiring materials for his weapons through eBay. The investigation is ongoing to determine if Rahami had any assistance in building the bombs.

Ryan Collins, a man from Pennsylvania, has been sentenced to 18 months in jail for hacking into the accounts of celebrities and stealing nude photos and videos. He pleaded guilty to the charges and had stolen the usernames and passwords of over 600 people, including Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Scarlett Johansson, and Kirsten Dunst. Collins tricked his victims by sending emails that appeared to be from Google or Apple. Although he accessed the photos between 2012 and 2014, he was not charged with releasing them. Prosecutors have found no evidence linking Collins to the leaks or sharing the obtained information. He accessed at least 50 iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts using fraudulent email addresses. Collins was originally charged in Los Angeles but was sentenced in Pennsylvania, his home state.

Mexico is bracing for the consequences of a Trump presidency, as his campaign promises of building a wall, renegotiating trade deals, and deporting Mexican immigrants threaten the country's economy and relationship with the US. The peso has already suffered a significant drop, and experts predict a turbulent financial future for Mexico. The election has also caused an existential crisis for Mexico, as it reflects the negative image the country has in the US. Canada is also concerned about the impact of Trump's presidency, particularly on trade. While some Canadians reacted with anxiety, others saw it as an opportunity for pride. The election has forced Mexico to rethink its relationship with the US, and President Peña Nieto has expressed his willingness to work with Trump. However, paying for a wall is out of Mexico's vision, and the country hopes to continue collaborating with the US for mutual development. The election will likely have the most profound impact on the economy, as the US and Mexico are deeply integrated in terms of trade and employment. Mexico is America's third-largest trading partner, and millions of American jobs are tied to trade with Mexico. Trump's argument that Mexico benefits more from NAFTA than the US resonated with some voters, but experts believe that Mexico has little leverage to apply pressure in the relationship. An economic crisis in Mexico could lead to a migration crisis, as Mexicans may seek work in the US. However, some believe that the threat from the outside will bring Mexicans together and encourage them to work harder. There is optimism that Trump's hostile talk will diminish once he takes office, and that economic factors will temper his policies towards Mexico. However, with the Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump's victory signals an ideological realignment in the US.

The text discusses how Donald Trump was able to give a voice to the pain and anger of millions of Americans who felt ignored and dismissed by the political elite. These individuals had been poorly educated and lacked the words to express their feelings and experiences. Trump appealed to their fears and frustrations, promising to restore their world and make America great again. The text also highlights the long-standing anger and despair that has been building for decades due to job loss and economic changes. The media and policymakers often use clinical terms to describe the struggles faced by these workers, while corporations prioritize profits over human decency. Trump's supporters accepted his controversial actions because they felt he understood their perspective.

A six-week-old girl died after falling down an elevator shaft in a Brooklyn apartment building. The mother attempted to push the stroller into the out-of-service elevator on the 23rd floor, but it wasn't there. Both the mother and the baby fell onto the roof of the elevator and then dropped further to the 17th floor. The baby was found unconscious and unresponsive and was pronounced dead at the hospital. The cause of death is still unknown, and an investigation is ongoing. The apartment complex has a history of elevator violations, with over 120 violations since 2005. The elevator involved in the incident had been inspected recently, and one non-hazardous violation was issued. The building's elevator service company declined to comment, and the Elevator Industries Association did not respond to inquiries. The incident is now under investigation, and all elevators in the complex will be tested for safety.

A new study by Arizona State University researchers found that middle school is the most stressful time for mothers. The study involved analyzing surveys from over 2,200 well-educated moms across the country, and mothers of only middle-school-age children reported the highest levels of stress, loneliness, and emptiness. Middle school is a challenging time for children, with raging hormones, changing bodies and brains, exposure to peer pressure and risky behaviors, and a desire for independence while still feeling dependent on parents. Parents often struggle to navigate these changes and may not realize that their children still want a relationship with them. It is important for parents to listen, be supportive, and not give up during this time. Developing a strong relationship during middle school can carry into the teen years and young adulthood. Mothers should also reach out to other moms for support during this challenging time.

However, the thought of torturing a chicken for slaughter turns my stomach. There needs to be an ethical solution to the slaughtering of all animals, not just chicken. And I believe a universal approach that is easily controlled and monitored would be ideal, but most likely not cost efficient.	Scientists have found that the method used by the U.S. poultry industry to stun chickens before slaughter does not consistently render them unconscious. This means that a significant number of chickens likely experience intense suffering when they are killed. The lack of regulations governing the humane slaughter of chickens in the U.S. has allowed poultry companies to prioritize meat quality over ensuring that chickens are reliably stunned. Animal protection groups are pressuring companies to phase out the use of electric water-baths and adopt alternative methods, such as controlled atmosphere killing. Gas stunning systems are considered more humane and produce better meat quality. The current process of slaughtering chickens also causes them stress and pain, with many experiencing broken bones and wing damage. The U.S. Agriculture Department estimates that hundreds of thousands of birds are unintentionally boiled alive each year. Animal welfare groups are campaigning to improve conditions for broiler chickens and some companies, like Perdue Farms, have pledged to install gas stunning systems in their facilities.

ISIS has executed 232 people near Mosul and taken tens of thousands as human shields against advancing Iraqi forces, according to the United Nations. The terror group carried out mass killings as punishment for defying its orders. Since October 17, ISIS has taken tens of thousands of men, women, and children from the outskirts of Mosul into the city, intending to use them as human shields. Iraqi forces have launched an operation to cut ISIS supply lines west of Mosul. Reports indicate that ISIS has abducted thousands of families from various areas. The use of human shields is a violation of international humanitarian law. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned ISIS's strategy and urged those fighting ISIS not to carry out revenge attacks. The Mosul operation has already displaced thousands of people, and camps have been set up to accommodate them. Civilians continue to flee despite the risks involved.
203	6.2	1.0	This is just disgusting. I cannot believe that this is happening to people. Why are people afraid to go to the doctor? there is no reason for this. I am numb to all this madness and I cannot believe I am writing about a man's penis right now. I cannot find any excuse for this and people need to be educated about the healthcare system so they are not so afraid of it.	disgust	2	4	3	34	30000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.286	4.2860000000000005	4.428999999999999	249	I am a 34-year-old female of African American descent.

A man in China inserted a 7-inch long stainless-steel chopstick into his penis to investigate blood in his urine. He had to undergo surgery to remove the object, which had reached his rectal wall. Doctors warned that pushing it further could have been fatal. The man is now recovering in the hospital, but it is unclear if he will experience any long-term damage.
253	2.2	1.0	I feel like the world is so corrupt that it no longer makes me feel anything. I expect the worst from this world and only am surprised when something exceedingly good happens. That is a shame that such a gruesome scene cannot even make me feel anything. The world is a cesspool and we no longer have any integrity to show for it.	sadness	2	4	3	34	30000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.286	4.2860000000000005	4.428999999999999	249	I am a 34-year-old female of African American descent.

Police in Hope, Indiana, shared a disturbing photo of a mother passed out in her car from a drug overdose, with her 10-month-old son crying in the backseat. The incident highlights a growing trend of parents using drugs with their children in the car to avoid disapproval. The mother was revived with Narcan and charged with child neglect and possession of drug paraphernalia. The child now lives with his grandmother. This case is similar to a previous incident in East Liverpool, Ohio, where a couple overdosed with their 4-year-old son in the car. The police hope that sharing these photos will discourage drug users from endangering children. The opioid crisis continues to claim the lives of about 78 Americans every day.
344	4.2	1.0	This is such a weird experience and so unexplained. Why are so many people dying in the Med? there are not enough safety measures being put in place so that people can safely enjoy themselves. It is so easy to take someone's money but then you do not give them the safety that they paid for. It's sad and such a shame but honestly, I not at all surprised.	sadness	2	4	3	34	30000	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	1.286	4.2860000000000005	4.428999999999999	249	I am a 34-year-old female of African American descent.

The death toll in the Mediterranean Sea has reached a new record number, with over 4,600 people dead or missing this year. The central Mediterranean route, mainly departing from Libya, has seen the highest number of deaths. The issue is not the lack of resources in rescue operations, but the instability and violence in Libya, where human traffickers exploit people's hopes for a better life. The Libyan Civil War worsened the situation, leaving vulnerable migrants in a dangerous position. Traffickers are increasingly unconcerned with safety, forcing migrants to make the journey in rough seas without proper equipment. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) advocates for long-term policies that provide information about the dangers of the journey and safe passages for migrants. The IOM is also fighting against a negative narrative on migration, highlighting its historical positive impact.
