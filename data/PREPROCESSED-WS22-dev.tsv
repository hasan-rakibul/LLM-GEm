"At least 26 Afghan civilians were killed and many others injured in airstrikes in Kunduz province, Afghanistan, while NATO and Afghan forces were fighting Taliban fighters. Two American service members also died in ground clashes. Conflicting reports on the number of casualties and no official account of the airstrikes have been provided. Some local officials claim that up to 100 civilians were killed or wounded. The incident is reminiscent of the tragic events in Kunduz last year when a U.S. airstrike mistakenly targeted a hospital, killing 42 patients and staff members. NATO officials have not confirmed the reported deaths of the civilians. Angry relatives of the victims attempted to protest, but were stopped by security forces. U.S. military officials confirmed the deaths of the two American service members and stated their commitment to helping Afghan partners defend their nation. The NATO mission in Afghanistan issued a statement referring to airstrikes by ""friendly forces"" but did not confirm any civilian casualties. The Taliban claimed that three of their fighters were targeted and killed, along with a large number of civilians."

New research suggests that habitat degradation poses a greater risk to the survival of turtles and tortoises than rising global temperatures. Over 60% of these species are listed as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered due to factors such as trading, collection for food and medicine, and habitat degradation. The study used climate models and the fossil record to investigate the impact of long-term climate change on these species. Results show that turtles and tortoises were able to withstand warmer climates in the past as long as there was enough water to support them. However, they are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, making climate change a significant threat to their conservation status.

The Supreme Court has halted the execution of an Alabama death row inmate, Thomas D. Arthur, for the seventh time. The execution was scheduled for Thursday evening but was stayed as officials waited for the Supreme Court to consider his appeals. Justice Clarence Thomas issued an order halting the execution until further notice. The court later granted Arthur's stay request, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voting in favor as a courtesy to his colleagues. The stay will remain in place until the justices decide whether to consider the case. Arthur was sentenced to death for the 1982 killing of Troy Wicker, the husband of a woman with whom Arthur had an affair. His attorneys argued against Alabama's lethal injection protocol and suggested execution by firing squad instead. The state's Department of Corrections is only allowed to carry out executions by injection and electrocution. Alabama's death penalty system has faced increased scrutiny following a Supreme Court ruling that struck down Florida's death penalty system.

The number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen has risen to 1,410 within three weeks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The outbreak was declared on October 6, and by October 10, there were 24 suspected cases. However, as of Thursday, there were 1,410 suspected cases in 10 out of Yemen's 23 governorates. The conflict between a Saudi Arabia-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi group has destroyed much of Yemen's infrastructure, making it difficult to control the disease outbreak. Cholera is just one of the risks in Yemen's war, which has left millions displaced and in need of medical help. Only 47 of the suspected cases have tested positive for cholera, and the outbreak has spread beyond the capital to nine other governorates. Children under 10 account for half of the cases, with six deaths from cholera and 36 associated deaths from acute watery diarrhea. Prompt treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics is crucial in severe cases.

A study published in Plos One reveals that Americans waste a significant amount of food, with about 133 billion pounds of edible food going uneaten in 2010. Two-thirds of this waste is attributed to consumers. The paper highlights the negative environmental impact of food waste, as 95% of it ends up in landfills. Ohio State University professor Brian Roe suggests that increasing awareness of the issue can lead to purposeful action to reduce food waste. A national survey conducted last year found that 53% of Americans are aware of the problem, a 10% increase from a previous study. The survey also revealed that many people believe throwing away food after the package date reduces the risk of food-related illnesses and that some food waste is necessary for freshness. Additionally, 77% of respondents feel guilty about wasting food, while 58% understand the environmental consequences. However, 51% believe it is difficult to reduce home food waste, and 42% claim to lack the time to address the issue.

A tugboat crash in British Columbia's coastal waters caused a diesel fuel leak, endangering wildlife and prompting efforts to recover the affected species. Divers found endangered abalone and juvenile herring in the fuel spill area. The outer boom meant to contain the oil broke free, spreading the oil further. Salvage crews have recovered 40% of the estimated 200,000 liters of fuel. The marine life in the Gale Passage, including a crucial herring spawning area, is at risk. The local clam fishery has been shut down, and the spill response has been criticized. Diesel is highly toxic to marine creatures. Additional protection measures are being considered.

Investors are becoming hesitant to invest in Ethiopia due to recent violent protests. The unrest, which began last year, has led to attacks on industrial farms and factories, particularly those with state ties or owned by foreigners. Ethiopia's industrialization program and economic growth are at risk as current investors reconsider their options and new ones shy away. The government declared a state of emergency in response to the violence, leading to concerns from international organizations. The government has promised to help investors recoup their losses, but the future remains uncertain. Many investors are waiting to see if the government can address the underlying issues causing the unrest.

Many patients avoid colonoscopies due to the unpleasant preparation process, which involves drinking a salty, repulsive-tasting drink and laxative. However, a Boston-based company called ColonaryConcepts is developing bowel-clearing food bars and drinks that taste more like fruit smoothies and chocolate. These products have been tested in a phase 2 trial and have shown promising results in terms of effectiveness and patient satisfaction. The new colonoscopy prep is scheduled to begin phase 3 trials next year and could potentially enter the market in 2018. This alternative option aims to improve the tolerability and cleansing effect of the preparation process. It is important for patients to not put off colonoscopies, as they are crucial for detecting and preventing colon cancer.

The Obama administration has announced that it will resume deportations of undocumented Haitian immigrants due to a surge in Haitian migrants seeking to enter the United States. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, deportations were suspended, but they were partially resumed later on for those convicted of serious crimes or considered a threat to national security. However, since last spring, thousands of Haitian migrants who had moved to Brazil for work have been making their way to the United States. These migrants have been allowed to enter the country and given permission to stay for up to three years under a humanitarian parole provision. With the full resumption of deportations, Haitians without visas will now be put into expedited removal proceedings. The surge in Haitian migrants has overwhelmed shelters in Tijuana, and many migrants have chosen to sleep on the streets. The change in American policy has surprised advocates in San Diego and Tijuana, who object to the policy change that does not reflect any actual change in reality.

Three U.S. military trainers were killed in Jordan when their vehicle failed to stop at the gate of a military base and security forces opened fire. The incident occurred at the King Faisal Air Base, and the cause is currently under investigation. Jordan is a close ally of the United States and is part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria. The U.S. Embassy in Amman stated that they are in contact with Jordanian authorities and do not believe the incident was terrorism-related. The King Faisal base is used for joint exercises and training Western-backed Syrian rebels. There are over 1,000 U.S. military personnel based in Jordan, primarily serving as advisers. Jordan's military has been on high alert since a deadly attack in June 2016.

This is going to be bad for the many people who making their living producing coffee. It is estimated that 125 million people make their living this way. This is going to be bad for these people who are already struggling.	A report commissioned by Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand warns that climate change poses a significant threat to the world's coffee supply. The report highlights the impact of warming temperatures on farmland, which will reduce the global area suitable for coffee by about 50%. It also emphasizes the increased risk of diseases and pests, such as coffee rust and the coffee berry borer. Major coffee companies have been aware of these threats for years and have been implementing support programs for coffee growers. However, the report suggests that no single company is large enough to tackle the challenge of climate change on its own. The World Coffee Research group is developing adaptive strategies to address the issue, including preserving genetic diversity, creating a variety catalog, and evaluating new coffee varieties. Despite these efforts, there are still major gaps in knowledge on how to best help coffee producers adapt to climate change. The report raises concerns about the livelihoods of the 125 million people worldwide who depend on coffee, particularly those in developing countries. Urgent action is needed to prevent devastating consequences for these communities.

Members of the band Eagles of Death Metal, who were playing at the Bataclan concert hall during the Paris Attacks, attended a memorial in Paris to honor the 130 people killed in the coordinated terrorist attacks. The band's frontman, Jesse Hughes, praised the city's response to the tragedy. Sting performed the first show at the Bataclan since the attacks, but Hughes was not allowed to enter due to his previous comments about Muslim security personnel collaborating with the attackers. Hughes later apologized for his statement. At the memorial, Hughes expressed his gratitude to the people of France. Sting's performance included a moment of silence and a statement in French to remember the victims and celebrate the venue's history.

"This year is on track to be the warmest on record, and if carbon emissions continue to rise, record hot years will become the ""new normal"" by 2025. The damage has already been done, and the global average temperature of 2015 will be the norm by 2040. Extreme seasons will become the norm within decades if emissions continue as usual. However, there is still hope to prevent record-breaking heat at a seasonal and regional level with immediate action on carbon emissions. The Paris climate agreement's proposed emissions cuts are not enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. To keep global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius, emissions need to be slashed by an additional 25 percent by 2030. Despite concerns about President-elect Donald Trump's stance on climate change, world leaders and activists remain committed to battling climate change."

Management and ownership at a Saskatoon dog kennel were warned about multiple serious problems with their animal care methods before the death of 14 large breed dogs. The kennel was warned about ventilation problems, among other issues, by a certified master trainer and kennel care expert. The SPCA also received a copy of the complaints but is unable to pursue them due to lack of power. The dogs died of heat exhaustion after a malfunction in the building's heating system caused the room they were in to become excessively hot. The kennel manager expressed remorse and stated that the upper-floor room where the deaths occurred has been closed off. The kennel will remain open. The kennel had previously received positive reviews from customers, but the trainer who raised concerns said that customers don't see the full picture. The trainer quit after management refused his suggestions and took his list of concerns to the SPCA. The SPCA is part of a coalition urging the provincial Ministry of Agriculture to reform legislation to better protect animals.

For nearly a century, the Canadian government forcibly assimilated indigenous Canadians by taking them from their families and placing them in church-run boarding schools. These schools punished students for speaking their native languages or observing indigenous traditions, and subjected them to physical and sexual assault, medical experimentation, and sterilization. Photographer Daniella Zalcman's book, Signs of Your Identity, documents the lasting effects of this trauma through double exposure portraits of former students and related places or items. The system caused the death of at least 6,000 children, and the last Indian Residential School closed in 1996. The government issued its first apology in 2008.

Just because she is Tai does not mean she is less likely to be devoted to the country."	Senator Mark Kirk apologized to his opponent, Representative Tammy Duckworth, after using her Thai heritage to criticize her family's military history during a debate. Duckworth accepted the apology and urged Kirk to focus on the issues. Kirk had questioned Duckworth's ties to the American Revolution, to which she responded by highlighting her family's long history of military service. Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's campaign manager, mocked Kirk over the incident. Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who lost her legs and partial use of her right arm during a mission, was born in Thailand but has deep American roots. Kirk has previously faced criticism for misrepresenting his military career. Duckworth's opponents have also faced criticism for attacking her war record.

The democracts should look within on solving there problems. they should focus on nominating a better candidate the next time around."	The Democratic Party suffered a shocking defeat in the recent election, with Donald Trump winning key demographics that were expected to support Democrats. Many Obama voters flipped to Trump, and he outperformed Romney among union households, whites without a college degree, and low-income households. The success of Obama's coalition may have been due to his unique talent as a politician, rather than a stable majority. The Democratic Party is now facing a struggle for dominance between Sanders supporters and the establishment wing. With no legislative victories in sight and upcoming electoral losses, the party's future is uncertain. Economic insecurity may have contributed to the rise of racism and far-right political parties. To prevent the views that led to Trump's victory, Democrats need to focus on delivering economic gains to working people.

It is clear that humans are at least somewhat responsible, but scientists disagree just to what extent humans are responsible for the changing climate"	President-Elect Donald J. Trump's policies could have catastrophic effects on the planet's climate. By withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and terminating President Obama's Clean Power Plan, Trump could push global temperatures to rise higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius, leading to devastating consequences such as extreme weather patterns and mass extinctions. While other countries are committed to their climate commitments, Trump's actions could encourage them to abandon their commitments and emit more greenhouse gases. Trump's denial of climate change and his intention to cut off American support for UN climate science further exacerbate the situation. However, climate activists and environmental leaders are determined to continue their efforts at the local and state levels, pushing for emissions-restriction plans and the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure. Despite the divisions between Democrats and Republicans on climate policy, there is bipartisan support for investments in clean energy and climate resilience. The construction of wind and solar power plants could not only address climate change but also boost U.S. manufacturing and reduce electricity costs. The willingness of Trump and Republican leaders to support such initiatives remains uncertain.

The message, likely sent by the Syrian government, also gave rebels an ultimatum to surrender or be killed. While there were no reports of bombardment by Monday afternoon, witnesses spotted fighter jets in the city. Russian warplanes have been backing the regime with airstrikes since September, causing destruction in Aleppo. The UN warned that the city is on the brink of starvation and lacks essential supplies. Turkey has been carrying out airstrikes in northern Syria to support the Free Syrian Army and plans to move on to Manbij after liberating al-Bab from ISIS. This move has stirred sectarian tensions and complicated efforts to free Syrian cities from ISIS control. Turkey considers some Kurdish militia groups as terrorists, while the US supports and arms them. The conflict between the US and Russia over which groups to target in Syria further complicates the situation.

Consumer Reports has released a report identifying fifteen supplement ingredients that can cause illness or even death. The risks associated with these ingredients include cancer, organ damage, and cardiac arrest. The severity of the threats depends on factors such as pre-existing conditions, the quantity of ingredients taken, and the length of exposure. The report lists the dangerous ingredients, including aconite, caffeine powder, chaparral, coltsfoot, comfrey, germander, greater celandine, green tea extract powder, Kava, lobelia, methylsynephrine, pennyroyal oil, red yeast rice, usnic acid, and Yohimbe. The report warns against the use of these ingredients due to their potential health risks. The CDC has reported that the use of dietary supplements in the United States is common, with over forty percent of the population using them from 1998 to 2004. Multivitamins and multiminerals are the most commonly used products.

The occupation of the refuge, which began in January, was a protest against federal control of land. The defendants argued that they did not intend to prevent federal officers from going to work, and the jury was unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that they had. The acquittal has been seen as a victory for states' rights and a blow to the federal government. The case against a second group of defendants is due to go to trial in February.

"A man in Australia escaped with cuts to his leg after a shark collided with his surfboard near Byron Bay. The incident led to the closure of local beaches for 24 hours. The shark emerged from under the man while he was waiting for a wave, causing minor lacerations to his leg. The type of shark involved is unknown. This attack follows a similar incident in the same area a few weeks ago. The New South Wales coast has seen 14 unprovoked shark attacks in 2015, with a hotspot from Evans Head to Byron Bay. Efforts to control shark populations have been challenging, with a recent shark eco-barrier trial being canceled due to rough sea conditions. The government plans to increase tagging and relocation of sharks using ""smart drumlines"" to catch them. Shark attacks are on the rise due to the popularity of water sports and the movement of bait fish closer to shore, although fatalities are still rare."

"The eldest generation in Russia, known as the ""children of the war,"" are living in poverty. Despite surviving World War II and other hardships, they are struggling to make ends meet on a meager pension. The falling ruble and rising prices have made it difficult for pensioners to afford basic necessities. Many have resorted to selling apples and relying on secondhand clothing and homegrown food. Medical care is also a challenge, as the cost of treatment is often too high. The government's response has been inadequate, offering a one-time payment instead of increasing pensions. Despite these difficulties, pensioners in Oryol have found solace in a DIY school for the elderly, where they can learn new skills and find companionship. However, they still long for a better quality of life and feel frustrated by the lack of support from the government."

Despite significant progress in global vaccination efforts, measles still claims the lives of more than 350 children daily, according to a report by UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and other health agencies. The report emphasizes that the fight against measles is hindered not by a lack of tools or knowledge, but by a lack of political will to ensure every child is immunized. While vaccination campaigns and increased routine vaccine coverage have saved millions of lives, there are still countries where a majority of children are not vaccinated. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan account for half of all unvaccinated babies and 75% of measles-related deaths. Outbreaks of measles in various countries, caused by gaps in immunization, remain a significant problem. The report highlights the need to immunize young people who have missed out on vaccinations and notes that measles tends to resurge during conflicts or humanitarian crises.

Cows produce a lot of methane from their backsides that eats away at the ozone and makes it dangerous down here on the earth surface. People feel its imporant that more people become vegetarian because it would limit the amount of cows and the level of methane in the air.	Cows release methane gas, a greenhouse gas, which has a much higher negative effect on the climate compared to carbon dioxide. The livestock industry, including cattle breeding and farming, is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector. Livestock pastures and feed production use a significant portion of the Earth's land surface, leading to deforestation and habitat loss. The increasing demand for meat and dairy products contributes to the overgrowth of the farming industry and its impact on global warming. Producing one kilogram of beef emits an equivalent amount of CO2 as an average European car every 250 kilometers and consumes a significant amount of energy. Consuming less meat and dairy products is an effective way to reduce one's carbon footprint and protect the environment.

Do you think I Should go to my doctor? I'm scared! Or am I being paranoid? What do you think? What would you do?	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a viral infection that poses a greater threat to infants in the United States than Zika, but it is rarely discussed. CMV can cause permanent disabilities such as hearing loss, microcephaly, intellectual deficits, and vision abnormalities in up to 20% of infected infants. There is no vaccine or standard treatment for CMV, but there are hints that antiviral drugs may benefit some newborns. CMV is transmitted through contact with saliva and urine, often from diaper-wearing children to adults. Pregnant women often get it from toddlers, especially those in day care. However, few women are warned about this infection, and less than half of obstetrician-gynecologists provide information on how to avoid CMV. Some experts argue that education campaigns and infant screening for the infection should be carried out to prevent the devastating effects of CMV. Routine screening of newborns for CMV is being pushed to identify those who are infected early and provide them with necessary tests and treatment. A recent study found that infants with CMV symptoms at birth who took an antiviral drug for six months had better hearing and cognitive skills at 2 years. However, it is not yet known if antiviral medication is safe and effective for babies with only hearing loss as a symptom. CMV infection can have long-term effects on a child's development, and the full extent of these effects may not be known until the child is in school.

The WHO criticized governments for not addressing this issue and failing to protect children's rights. They highlighted studies linking childhood obesity to the marketing of unhealthy food and beverages high in fat, sugar, and salt. The organization called on Member States to introduce restrictions on advertising these products on all platforms, including the internet. The WHO also expressed concern about video bloggers who promote junk food and have a significant influence on children. They are currently reviewing which foods and drinks can run ads targeting children.

The suspect, who appeared to die from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, knew the victim's schedule and routine. The airport was closed and flights were canceled or diverted while police investigated. The airport has high security, but it is unclear if surveillance cameras captured the shooting. The victim, Michael Winchester, was a ramp supervisor for Southwest Airlines. He was described as a former student athlete at the University of Oklahoma, and his son currently plays for the Kansas City Chiefs.

The suspect, who was wearing historic military attire with Nazi emblems, was shot dead by police. He had a semi-automatic handgun, a semi-automatic rifle, a knife, and 2,600 rounds of live ammunition, all legally purchased. Six victims were taken to the hospital, and three were treated at the scene. The motive for the attack is believed to be the suspect's troubled relationship with his law firm. This incident occurred just days after a shooting at a shopping center in Washington state, where five people were killed.

Reno served as attorney general under President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001. She was known for her dedication to justice, equality, and criminal justice reform.

Two soldiers were killed by attackers armed with guns, knives, and spears. In retaliation, the government used helicopters to fire at the attackers. The area is closed to Western journalists, making it difficult to verify the scale of the fighting. The Rohingya have been under siege since the government sent security forces to hunt for armed Rohingya assailants who had killed nine police officers. Human rights groups have received reports of killings, rapes, and beatings of Rohingya civilians. Western diplomats have called for an independent investigation into the violence, but Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has declined. The Rohingya population has been subjected to decades of repression, making them susceptible to radicalization. The government's harsh proposals may have been the catalyst for the recent attacks. The Rohingya villages have become armed camps, with reports of food scarcity, curfews, and rape by soldiers. Myanmar officials deny the occurrence of rapes.

I guess I assumed that any issues would have been addressed by that government. I had no clue that there was unrest and tension in regards to the Muslim population. What is going on in this world?	A security crackdown in northern Rakhine state, Burma, following militant attacks has worsened the humanitarian situation and drawn international attention to Aung San Suu Kyi's government. The government has accused the Rohingya Muslim community of being behind the attacks, leading to a manhunt and reports of abuse by the military. The United Nations and the US have called for investigations into the alleged abuse and the restoration of humanitarian access. Human Rights Watch has reported burned villages and alleged rape of Muslim women by soldiers. The crisis is seen as a major test for Suu Kyi's new government, which is accused of not doing enough to address the Rohingya crisis. The Rohingya, who are essentially stateless, are considered illegal immigrants by many in the Buddhist-majority country. The security crackdown has displaced thousands of people and disrupted access to healthcare and food assistance. Suu Kyi has called for strengthening border security, following the rule of law, and creating a development plan for the area. However, the Rohingya community does not believe there is a militant group operating in the state and accuses the government of deliberate assassination. The crisis has further eroded confidence in Suu Kyi's government among the affected population.

The Marrakesh Climate Talks are taking place amidst dangerously hot weather in North Africa. Record-breaking temperatures this summer have raised concerns about the impact of climate change on the region. Even if warming is limited to 2°C, the Mediterranean region would still experience unprecedented changes. Morocco could face increased temperatures and drought, leading to the displacement of forests and expansion of deserts. The fossil fuel industry's recklessness is pushing the planet towards catastrophe, and urgent action is needed to address this. Governments must divest from climate destruction and invest in renewable energy. Ending fossil fuel subsidies and removing the industry's influence from climate talks are crucial steps. Legal action is also being taken against major carbon emitters. The demand to world leaders is to stop new fossil fuel projects and transition to 100% renewable energy.

Teach for America, an organization that recruits and trains teachers for schools serving underprivileged students, is preparing for the potential end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program under the Trump administration. The organization has 146 teachers who are not documented citizens and are protected under DACA. Viridiana Carrizales, who planned for a Trump presidency, has developed a plan to help these teachers relocate and navigate immigration issues. Teach for America got involved in immigration policy in 2012 when they lobbied for the DREAM Act. When DACA became an option in 2014, Teach for America provided resources to help aspiring teachers go through the approval process. The status of these teachers is causing concern for the organization's top executive, Elisa Villanueva Beard. Teach for America teachers with DACA status also have undocumented students in their classes and discuss these issues in a private Facebook group. Carrizales, who came to the US illegally from Mexico, worries about the 146 DACAmented teachers and their families. Despite the sadness and fear among the teachers, there is a sense of resilience and determination to come through stronger.

The large Somali community in Minneapolis went through a rigorous screening process to enter the US, but younger generations are struggling to earn a living. Donald Trump's anti-immigrant stance is based on a false notion that the country's safety is at risk from Muslim extremists due to lax vetting policies. In reality, refugees face a lengthy screening process by the United Nations before coming to the US. However, once in the country, they receive limited support in terms of job-search help and cash assistance, making it difficult for them to integrate into the American economy. This lack of support contributes to refugee families' difficulty in escaping poverty and younger generations' sense of isolation.

The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline received a significant increase in calls, with the volume being two to three times higher than usual. The Crisis Text Line also experienced a surge in texts, with eight times the normal volume. The Trevor Project, which provides support to LGBTQ youth, saw a doubling of call volume, with more than 95% of callers discussing the election. The Trans Lifeline, which supports the transgender community, has been flooded with calls since the election, receiving more than 500 calls a day. The election results have caused panic and fear among callers, particularly regarding the potential loss of insurance and trans-affirming healthcare. These crisis hotlines are urging people to support each other, get back to routines, and limit exposure to media that exacerbates feelings of hopelessness. Acts of kindness and compassion are also encouraged to help alleviate anxiety.

A recent study has found that rates of toddlers and preschoolers being hospitalized for opioid overdoses have more than doubled in recent years. The study analyzed data from over 13,000 records of children admitted to U.S. hospitals between 1997 and 2012. The increase in overdoses is possibly due to the rise in prescribed painkillers, such as OxyContin and Vicodin. Young children are often exposed to these drugs by finding pills on the floor, getting into their parents' purses, or opening bottles. The study emphasizes the need for parents to limit children's exposure to these medications and for companies to improve packaging. The study also highlights the underreported issue of young overdoses in the pediatrics community. Additionally, the study found that heroin poisonings among children increased by 161%.

The Chicago Police Department is facing a digital archive that documents two decades of torture by its officers. The archive, called the Chicago Torture Archive, contains over 10,000 documents related to cases of torture between 1972 and 1991. These cases involved over 100 black men who were tortured by police officers to force confessions or intimidate witnesses. The archive, which will be housed at the University of Chicago, includes interrogations, trial files, journalism works, and records of activism. The launch of the archive coincides with recent efforts in Chicago to address police misconduct, including the passing of the Reparations for Burge Torture Victims ordinance. The archive's director hopes that the lessons learned from these cases can inform and inspire young activists. While the archive provides a comprehensive resource for studying the cases, there are concerns about privacy and whether victims and their families were made aware of the archive's existence. Despite these concerns, the archive is seen as an essential tool for academics, researchers, and historians to understand this dark chapter in Chicago's history. It also presents an opportunity for the police department to mend relationships with residents and increase transparency and accountability.

Nosey, a 34-year-old female African elephant, has been held captive and subjected to decades of abuse. She has been forced to live in solitary confinement, perform in circuses, and give rides to people. This has caused significant stress to her physical and psychological well-being. Nosey has spent most of her life in a small trailer, receiving little exercise and no socialization. She has developed arthritis due to her long-term confinement. Despite over 200 citations and 30 violations of the Animal Welfare Act by her owner, Hugo Tommy Liebel, the USDA has not taken action. Nosey is suffering from chronic, untreated health problems and lives in pain. The USDA has the power and responsibility to respond to citizen complaints and confiscate Nosey, releasing her into a proper elephant sanctuary.

Women are concerned about the potential threat to affordable birth control under the Trump-Pence administration. Trump and Pence have expressed intentions to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which covers birth control. In response, some women are considering getting an intrauterine device (IUD) as a long-lasting form of birth control that could outlast any changes made by the administration. IUDs are highly effective and safe, with some versions lasting up to 12 years. Women are advised to take action soon, as an IUD can cost up to $1,000 without insurance coverage. Planned Parenthood offers a guide for those interested in learning more about IUDs.

During a highway roadblock, an armed encounter occurred between Dimaukom's men and the police, resulting in the deaths of 10 men.

This year, a record number of people have drowned in the Mediterranean while attempting to escape war and seek a better life. Over 3,800 people have died, averaging about 90 deaths per week. The largest migration of refugees since World War II is currently taking place, with over 65 million people displaced from their homes. Despite fewer people crossing this year compared to 2015, the death toll has increased. The main routes across the Mediterranean are from Turkey to Greece, Libya to Italy, and West Africa to Spain. Syria produces the most refugees, with nearly five million fleeing the country due to civil war. The war in Syria has also resulted in an estimated 430,000 deaths. While some refugees are resettled in countries like the United States and Canada, the majority seek asylum in Europe or remain in the Middle East. With no end to the war in sight, the refugee crisis and the loss of lives will continue.

Also, if communities can begin reporting evidence of the disease sooner to medical providers, public health officials would have a head start in rushing resources to address emerging epidemics.	The text discusses the ongoing debate over the best approach to fighting cholera. On one side are public health advocates who believe that vaccines can make a significant impact in preventing and treating cholera. On the other side are public health officials who argue that vaccines are not effective enough and that the focus should be on improving water and sanitation infrastructure. The World Health Organization (WHO) has tried to support both approaches but has not settled on how to fund them. Cholera is a deadly disease caused by contaminated water, and it kills about 100,000 people worldwide each year. Two oral vaccines exist, but they have limitations and do not address the underlying causes of cholera. The debate over vaccines has caused division and hindered progress in the fight against cholera. The text also mentions the history of cholera and the breakthroughs in understanding and treating the disease. It highlights the devastating cholera outbreak in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and the missed opportunity to distribute vaccines. The text concludes by mentioning new ideas and approaches, such as using mobile phones to report cholera cases and promoting water sterilization tablets.

"Russia launched a major air offensive in Syria, targeting the rebel-held part of Aleppo just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with President-elect Donald Trump about their goals for ending the Syria crisis. The strikes were described as ongoing and were carried out by Russian Navy frigates and fighter jets. The Pentagon called the missile launches a ""show"" and stated that Russia already had enough firepower in Syria to cause serious damage. The Obama administration has been trying to negotiate a cease-fire in Aleppo for months, but the situation remains dire, with the city under siege and no aid allowed in since July. In addition to the military offensive, a joint report by the World Food Program and the Food and Agricultural Organization stated that food production in Syria has reached an all-time low, threatening to drive more people from their homes."

Russia has claimed that the UN aid convoy that was bombed in Syria on Monday night was escorted by terrorists, denying accusations that it was behind the attack. The convoy, which was delivering food aid to opposition-held parts of Aleppo, was hit shortly after the end of a ceasefire. The Russian defense ministry released drone footage showing a pickup truck carrying militants and a heavy mortar driving alongside the convoy before it was bombed. More than a dozen people were killed, including the director of the organization. The truce collapsed as leaders were gathered at the UN in New York to negotiate a longer-term peace plan. The US accused the Syrian government and Russia of violating the ceasefire, while Moscow accused the US-led coalition of aiding ISIS. The incident highlights the deep mistrust between the superpowers and the failure to achieve a lasting agreement to end the conflict.

I think no amount is too much to tackle this	Microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by malformed heads and stunted brain development, has been linked to the Zika virus. The severity of microcephaly can vary, but it often results in mental impairment. Detecting the condition before birth is difficult, leading to debates about abortion. Raising a child with microcephaly requires extensive care and support, which can be costly. Early intervention programs can help, but they often end after three years. The CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics have published guidelines for evaluating and caring for infants with Zika-related microcephaly. The cost of care for each child is estimated to be $10 million over a lifetime. Families with resources, like the Grounds family, can provide the best care for their child, but many others struggle. Nicholas, a child with microcephaly, has made progress with intensive intervention, but ongoing support is necessary. Parents of children with microcephaly need support throughout their lives. Genetic testing revealed that Nicholas inherited two mutated genes from his parents, causing microcephaly. The odds of their second child having the condition were one in four.

The investigation reveals that many Syrian refugees, who lack work permits, are forced to work illegally in factories for low wages. The factories often hide workers during audits and continue exploiting them once the auditors leave. Some brands are aware of the abuses and are trying to address them, but others are unaware of the conditions in their supply chain. The investigation concludes that until brands have full visibility into their supply chain, the exploitation of refugees and children is likely to persist.

Bananas absolutely must be saved.  I think this would be a serious issue if this were to actuallyh appen.	The Cavendish banana, which is the most widely sold banana in the Western world, is facing the threat of extinction due to its vulnerability to diseases. The previous popular variety, Gros Michel, was wiped out by a fungal disease called Fusarium wilt. The Cavendish replaced it but is now susceptible to a disease called Black Sigatoka. Additionally, a new strain of Fusarium wilt called Tropical Race 4 (TR4) is spreading and could devastate the banana industry. To combat these diseases, scientists are studying the genetics of wild banana varieties and banana pathogens to find resistant genes. However, there has been little effort and funding for this research. By increasing genetic diversity in cultivated bananas, the industry can reduce its vulnerability to diseases. Scientists have already identified the genome sequences of bananas and the fungi causing the diseases, which provides a basis for identifying disease-resistant genes. With the use of genetic engineering and plant breeding, these genes can be transferred into desired cultivars. It is crucial to increase the pool of genetic diversity in cultivated bananas to avoid repeating the history of the Gros Michel and Cavendish varieties.

The bodies of former Polish President Lech Kaczynski and his wife are being exhumed as part of a new investigation into the 2010 plane crash that killed 96 prominent Poles. The ruling party, Law and Justice, led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the late president's twin brother, has cast doubt on previous investigations and believes the crash was an assassination. They are seeking evidence against former Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who they believe had some involvement. The exhumations will involve tests to determine the cause of the crash, including checking for explosives. The exhumations are controversial, with some dismissing conspiracy theories and others upset at the violation of cultural taboos. The crash occurred while the delegation was traveling to honor Polish officers murdered by the Soviet secret police during World War II.

Armed police in North Dakota have arrested 141 Native American protesters and environmental activists who were occupying private land in the path of a controversial new oil pipeline. The police used non-lethal rounds, pepper spray, and sound cannons to push the protesters back to their main encampment on public land. Skirmishes lasted overnight and continued until early Friday morning. The protesters were demonstrating against the pipeline, which they believe threatens the region's water supply and crosses land never ceded by the tribe. The police claimed they used non-lethal bean bag rounds in response to stone throwing and a woman firing a pistol at officers.

Airstrikes by a U.S.-backed Saudi-led coalition in the Yemeni city of Hodeidah killed at least 43 people and injured many more, according to Yemeni officials and local news reports. The strikes targeted a security complex where prisoners were being held. The city is controlled by Houthi rebels, who also control the capital and much of northern Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition claimed that the complex was being used as a command center by the rebels. The airstrikes occurred on the same day that Yemen's internationally recognized president rejected a new U.N. peace proposal. The conflict in Yemen has resulted in the deaths of over 10,000 people and has caused a humanitarian crisis in the country.

"The suicides of two French girls who were bullied at school have sparked a debate about how to better protect teenagers. The story of Emilie, who took her own life in January, and the dramatization of Marion Fraisse's story, who died three years ago, have shed light on the issue of bullying in France. The film adaptation of Marion's story, titled ""Marion, 13 ans pour toujours - Marion, Forever 13,"" portrays the gradual descent of a young girl into depression and suicide. The film has prompted a discussion on social media, with many sharing their own experiences of bullying. France has attempted to address the problem with an anti-bullying law and a hotline for reporting incidents, but activists argue that more needs to be done. The issue of bullying extends beyond the school gates, with cyber-bullying also being a concern. Parents, teachers, and students are encouraged to openly discuss the problem to find a solution. Emilie's story, published in her diary, highlights the emotional and physical abuse she endured at school. A report by Unicef states that bullying is a global issue with severe negative effects on children's mental health. The recent attention on these tragic cases may lead to a change in how bullying is addressed in France."

However, the trial was discontinued due to side effects such as mood changes, depression, pain at the injection site, and increased libido. The article highlights the side effects of various birth control options for women, which are equally as bad but have not been halted. Women have always borne the burden of birth control, and the article argues that men should share in the responsibility.

The article points out the double standard in the standards for male and female birth control, with women being expected to endure more side effects.

A study has found that humans have destroyed about 10 percent of Earth's wilderness since 1992, equivalent to an area half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of Alaska. The research team from Australia's University of Queensland defines wilderness as an area with no human development. The destruction is primarily due to activities such as logging, agriculture, mining, and oil and gas exploration. The study aims to raise awareness and calls for international policies to protect remaining wilderness areas. The loss of wilderness is particularly significant in South America, which has experienced a 30 percent decline. The researchers warn that once wilderness is gone, it cannot be restored, emphasizing the need to protect what is left. The report criticizes the United Nations and others for ignoring the problem and highlights the urgency of taking action to prevent further loss.

"Prominent Republican women are concerned that defending Donald Trump against accusations of sexual assault is damaging the party's relationship with female voters. Trump's comments about women have been a source of concern throughout his campaign, but the release of a 2005 video and subsequent allegations by 11 women have escalated the issue. Many male Republicans have come to Trump's defense, dismissing the accusers and potentially alienating female voters. This division within the party comes as polls show that women are supporting Hillary Clinton by a significant margin. Female Republican strategists and politicians, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Carly Fiorina, have distanced themselves from Trump. The recent interview between Newt Gingrich and Megyn Kelly further highlighted the party's struggle with women voters. Republican women are increasingly feeling that the party does not represent them and are critical of the party's handling of Trump's behavior. The GOP's treatment of women is playing into the ""war on women"" narrative that Democrats have pushed in the past. Trump's personal attacks on women, both in the media and on social media, have also contributed to the party's struggle with female voters. Overall, many Republican women believe that the party is not doing enough to address the concerns of female voters and that this will have negative consequences for the party in the general election."

The US-backed air campaign in Yemen has been accused of war crimes, with rights groups and UN officials stating that the coalition has disregarded civilian casualties and failed to distinguish between civilian and military targets. Nearly 4,000 civilians have been killed in the war, with 60% of them dying in airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition. The war has caused widespread hunger and displacement, and warplanes have targeted medical centers, schools, and infrastructure. The US provides intelligence and logistical help to Saudi Arabia, but has reduced the number of military personnel advising the coalition. The coalition claims to investigate violations, but critics argue that the backing from the US and international community has given them a free rein. The strike on a hospital in Abs exemplifies the problems with the airstrikes, as the hospital was on a list of sites not to be targeted and had markings to indicate it was a medical facility. The strike has had a significant impact, with Doctors Without Borders pulling its personnel from northern Yemen and leaving the Abs hospital closed. Experts argue that the strikes on the taxi and hospital constitute war crimes.

His cattle have become semi-feral and roam over a large area near the Nevada, Utah, Arizona border. Bundy does not vaccinate or treat his cattle for disease, does not control breeding, and rarely brands them. The cattle are now reported to be slowly starving, although there is no official confirmation. The State of Nevada has not taken action to round up the cattle due to logistical difficulties and threats from Bundy supporters. Removing the cattle will be expensive and potentially dangerous, as they are near feral and aggressive. The value of the herd will also decline in the hot Nevada summer.

Frogs are an important part of our environment and we need to ensure that they are took care of. I think we need to focus on helping them survive something we as humans caused.	A study suggests that garden ponds are contributing to the spread of deadly frog diseases in the UK. Ranaviruses, which can infect amphibians, reptiles, and fish, have devastated common frog populations. The research indicates that infected animals from aquatic retailers or the movement of species between ponds may be worsening the problem. The virus appears to be spreading faster than frogs can hop, and human-aided dispersal is likely involved. Ranaviruses are a group of viruses found worldwide, and they can kill common frogs by causing sores and blisters on their skin or internal bleeding. Genetic records suggest that ranavirus was introduced to the UK on two separate occasions. Garden ponds can act as stepping stones for infected animals to reach new sites, and the transfer of frogspawn or frogs between ponds may be aiding the spread of the virus. The study emphasizes the need to manage the risk of disease outbreaks while still supporting wildlife by adding ponds to urban gardens. Limiting the movement of potentially-infectious material is strongly advised.

This is not the first time Trump has faced criticism for his response to white supremacists, as he was hesitant to disavow support from former KKK leader David Duke during the campaign.

A recent article in the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta has sparked a national debate in Russia about the role of social media in promoting suicide among young people. The article claims that Russia's most popular social network, VKontakte (VK), has numerous groups that encourage vulnerable young people to kill themselves. The article alleges that at least 80 recent suicides can be linked to these online groups. Critics have accused the article of sensationalism and placing too much emphasis on the internet as a cause of juvenile suicide. However, the article has also prompted law enforcement agencies to launch a criminal case over groups on VK that allegedly promote suicide. Russia has one of the highest rates of youth suicide in the world, and the article has brought much-needed attention to this serious issue.

Bayh has been attacked for his multiple homes, high earnings, and corporate ties. However, he still has a chance of winning, with recent polls showing a statistical tie between him and Young. Republicans are facing a cash crunch, with Bayh having a significant edge in ad spending. If Bayh wins, it would be a significant blow to GOP chances of holding their majority in the Senate. Bayh's entrance into the race was seen as a recruiting coup for the Democrats, and his bipartisan appeal has given him an advantage. Young's pitch is that Bayh has transformed from a centrist to a supporter of President Obama's agenda, using his positions to land post-Senate business. The attacks on Bayh's wealth resonate in Indiana, where the culture is parochial and politicians often emphasize their ""Hoosier"" identity. Bayh wants the race to focus on his accomplishments, such as the Evan Bayh 21st Century Scholars Program. However, the race has become increasingly negative, with outside groups playing a significant role."

A month after Hurricane Matthew hit southwestern Haiti, the region is facing widespread hunger and destruction. At least 800,000 people urgently need food, but there is not enough aid reaching the affected areas. Truckloads of food and medical supplies have been looted, and desperate crowds have clashed with police. The storm destroyed homes, crops, and livestock, leaving many without shelter or a means to survive. Cholera outbreaks are also occurring due to contaminated water supplies. The United Nations has only raised one-third of the emergency funding needed to help the affected population. The Haitian government, along with international relief organizations, is coordinating efforts to provide assistance, but political obstacles and the upcoming elections pose challenges. The situation is dire, with people sleeping under trees and lacking basic necessities. The destruction is so severe that some remote mountain villages may not receive aid until the end of November.

The author suggests that the party prioritized appealing to certain voters over appealing to women. She argues that Trump's comments were not just ""locker room talk"" but a confession of assault. The author highlights how the Republican Party ignored Trump's chauvinism and even used their influence to force Republicans to support him. She believes that the GOP will suffer in the election and calls for the political obituaries of Trump's defenders.

They state that humans are causing climate change, with evidence of rising seas, warming oceans and atmosphere, melting ice, changing rainfall patterns, and increasing acidity in the ocean. The scientists criticize politicians and real estate developers without scientific experience who deny climate change. They express sadness that the Republican Party, historically supportive of environmental initiatives, is now rejecting climate science. The scientists emphasize the economic and social costs of inaction and call for rational decision-making to manage climate change risks. They also criticize the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, for wanting to scrap environmental agreements. The scientists highlight the success of renewable energy sources in reducing emissions and argue that action to reduce pollution does not harm the economy. They warn that voting for anti-science politicians will contribute to the climate change problem and urge voters to consider the conversation they will have with their children about their choices.

ITT Technical Institute, a for-profit chain of schools in the US, will be closing down all of its campuses due to financial sanctions from the US Department of Education. The closure will affect hundreds of thousands of students and over 8,000 employees. ITT blamed the closure on the actions and sanctions from the Department of Education, which barred the company from enrolling new students using federal financial aid. The company has been found to be out of compliance with accreditor standards twice this year. For-profit colleges like ITT Tech have been criticized for charging high tuition fees without providing a valuable education. Some students may be eligible to have their federal student loans discharged and transfer their credits to another institution. This closure follows a similar situation with Corinthian Colleges in 2015.

"In his first televised sit-down interview since becoming President-elect, Donald Trump told his supporters to stop harassing minorities. He expressed sadness over reports of harassment and urged his supporters to ""stop it."" Trump also criticized the protests that have broken out since his election, calling them ""horrible"" and blaming the press for exaggerating the incidents. He discussed his plans for FBI Director James Comey, saying he hasn't made up his mind about whether to ask for his resignation. Trump also addressed his stance on same-sex marriage, abortion, and deporting undocumented immigrants. He pledged to focus on deporting criminals and building a border wall. Trump defended his transition team, which includes lobbyists, saying that they know the system but will be phased out. He stuck by his claim that he knows more than American generals about fighting ISIS. Trump also expressed support for ditching the Electoral College and handing the presidency to the winner of the popular vote. He dismissed concerns about the impact of his presidency on his family's businesses, saying that saving the country is more important. Trump plans to turn down the presidential salary and does not intend to change his tone."

The British Government is supporting an oil drilling project in Uganda's Murchison Falls National Park, which poses a significant risk to the endangered Rothschild giraffe species. The project involves drilling multiple wells in the park, which is home to one of the last remaining populations of these giraffes. Leaked documents reveal that the British oil company, Tullow Oil, has been in talks with the government to provide taxpayer-backed loans and insurance for the project. Conservationists have been relocating giraffes away from the drilling sites to protect them.

India's tiger population, which accounts for more than half of the world's total, has been rapidly declining due to human interference. While the population had been increasing in recent years, with 2,226 tigers in 2015 compared to 1,411 in 2005, this year has seen a significant increase in tiger deaths. 78 tigers have already died in the first 10 months of the year, surpassing the number of deaths in the same period over the past six years. The cause of some deaths is still being determined, but others have been attributed to human activities such as poaching, poisoning, electrocution, and road accidents. India has seized the largest number of tigers and tiger products, with 540 seizures between 2000 and 2015. The increase in tiger mortalities and seizures is a cause for concern, and experts emphasize the need for coordinated enforcement operations to combat illegal wildlife trade, which they describe as a transnational organized crime.

A judge declared a mistrial in the case of a white former police officer charged with murder in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black motorist during a traffic stop. The jury was deadlocked, with some leaning towards a conviction of voluntary manslaughter. The officer, Ray Tensing, shot Sam DuBose in the head after pulling him over for a missing license plate. Tensing testified that he feared for his life, but prosecutors argued that the evidence contradicted his story. The judge set a new hearing date to determine if the case will be retried. The DuBose family wants another trial and is disappointed with the jury's inability to reach a conclusion. The shooting has raised attention to how police deal with blacks. Legal experts say juries tend to give police officers the benefit of the doubt, but will convict if the actions were clearly unwarranted. The trial was conducted under heightened security due to the potential for unrest. The University of Cincinnati fired Tensing and reached a settlement with DuBose's family.

"The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has reported that levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have surpassed an important threshold and are unlikely to dip below it for ""many generations"". The 400 parts per million benchmark was broken globally for the first time in recorded history in 2015, and 2016 is expected to be the first full year to exceed this mark. The increase in CO2 levels can be attributed to a strong El Niño event, which caused drought conditions in tropical regions, reducing the ability of vegetation to absorb CO2. Additionally, there were extra emissions from fires sparked by the drier conditions. The WMO emphasizes the need to focus on cutting CO2 emissions in order to tackle climate change and keep temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius."

Toughie, the last Rabbs' fringe-limbed tree frog, has died, marking the extinction of his species. The frog, featured in the Photo Ark project, served as a symbol of the extinction crisis. Toughie's species was only described in 2008, three years after he was found during a frog rescue mission. The deadly chytrid fungus wiped out up to 85% of amphibians in Toughie's habitat. Photographer Joel Sartore, who photographed Toughie for the Photo Ark project, emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about extinction. He believes that people need to meet and fall in love with these animals to care about their preservation. The loss of species threatens healthy ecosystems and ultimately our own survival. Sartore warns that if we continue on this path, we could lose half of all species by the end of the century.

Mexico is bracing for the consequences of a Trump presidency, as his campaign promises of building a wall, renegotiating trade deals, and deporting Mexican immigrants threaten the country's economy and relationship with the US. The peso has already suffered a significant drop, and experts predict a turbulent financial future for Mexico. The election has also caused an existential crisis for Mexico, as it reflects the negative image the country has in the US. Canada is also concerned about the impact of Trump's presidency, particularly on trade. While some Canadians reacted with anxiety, others saw it as an opportunity for pride. The election has forced Mexico to rethink its relationship with the US, and President Peña Nieto has expressed his willingness to work with Trump. However, paying for a wall is out of Mexico's vision, and the country hopes to continue collaborating with the US for mutual development. The election will likely have the most profound impact on the economy, as the US and Mexico are deeply integrated in terms of trade and employment. Mexico is America's third-largest trading partner, and millions of American jobs are tied to trade with Mexico. Trump's argument that Mexico benefits more from NAFTA than the US resonated with some voters, but experts believe that Mexico has little leverage to apply pressure in the relationship. An economic crisis in Mexico could lead to a migration crisis, as Mexicans may seek work in the US. However, some believe that the threat from the outside will bring Mexicans together and encourage them to work harder. There is optimism that Trump's hostile talk will diminish once he takes office, and that economic factors will temper his policies towards Mexico. However, with the Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump's victory signals an ideological realignment in the US.

A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals that 90% of seabirds currently eat plastic in the ocean, and by 2050, virtually all seabirds will be consuming it. The research explains that seabirds rely on their sense of smell to hunt for food, and the scent emitted by plastic in the ocean tricks them into confusing it with food. The study also found that birds that track the scent of a sulfurous compound emitted by algae, which coats floating plastic, are six times more likely to consume plastic. The research sheds light on species that are often overlooked, such as petrels and shearwaters, which are impacted by plastic ingestion. The study highlights the need to address the growing plastic pollution in oceans, which affects not only seabirds but also sea turtles, fish, and other marine animals. The problem of plastic pollution starts on land, with nonpoint source pollution being one of the biggest contributors. The top five countries that dump plastics into oceans are China, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand.

The Forced From Home exhibit organized by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) aims to teach empathy for refugees by allowing participants to experience the journey of a displaced person. The exhibit has been attended by over 17,000 people, including 3,400 students. MSF hopes to communicate the reality of the refugee crisis and generate empathy in a time when anti-refugee sentiment is on the rise. The exhibit creates an empathetic response by assigning each participant a specific displaced person's identity and sharing personal stories from aid-workers who have served in MSF camps. The exhibit challenges the notion that empathy is a globalized response, as humans are wired to empathize with those in their immediate surroundings. However, empathy can be strengthened with practice and training programs have shown promise in changing people's responses to others' suffering. While empathy alone is not a solution to the refugee crisis, it is a necessary component in finding a genuine solution.

She pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child, a lesser charge than the original continuous sexual abuse charge. The relationship lasted for nine months, and Vera claimed that she and the victim loved each other. She said the boy's family accepted their relationship and even became excited when she became pregnant with his child. However, when Child Protective Services questioned her, she had an abortion. Neighbors reported seeing the boy at Vera's house frequently, and she claimed he was her brother. Vera will be sentenced in January, with prosecutors agreeing to a maximum term of 30 years. The boy will remain in foster care, and his parents have been ordered to undergo therapy and attend parent classes.

Teachers at his school had expressed concerns about his well-being, but social workers found no cause for alarm. The boy's stepfather believed he was living in Mexico until the mother revealed that he had died. The boy's body was found in a closet, severely malnourished and covered in pressure sores. The mother has been charged with murder and child abuse. The family lived in a one-bedroom house, with the boy kept hidden in closets and sedated with sleep medications. The other children in the family were aware of the situation but concealed it from their stepfather. The stepfather was devastated upon learning the truth and called the police. A public memorial was held for the boy, and the stepfather vowed to continue telling his story to prevent similar cases from happening again.

Indigenous communities in Labrador, Canada are protesting the construction of a hydroelectric dam due to concerns about the release of methylmercury into Lake Melville, which would contaminate their food sources. A study from Harvard's environmental scientist, Elsie Sunderland, predicts that the dam will expose communities to double the amount of methylmercury they currently ingest, potentially causing acute poisoning. The dam's developer, Nalcor Energy, acknowledges that methylmercury levels will spike but claims they will eventually return to pre-dam levels. However, Sunderland's study contradicts this claim. The study also highlights that other hydroelectric projects in Canada pose similar risks to indigenous populations. Indigenous leaders and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador have reached a compromise to address the methylmercury impact, but specific measures have not been determined yet.

Rescue teams are working to save more people trapped in the rubble of a collapsed 10-storey building in Kisii Town. The death toll currently stands at nine, with hopes of finding more survivors. The rescue efforts are being coordinated by the Kenya Defence Forces, Kenya Red Cross, and St-John Ambulance personnel. It is suspected that drilling underneath the building may have caused its collapse. The developer of the building is currently in hiding, and authorities are urging him to surrender for investigation. The blame game between the county and national governments has been criticized, with the focus being on rescue operations. Efforts are being made to save those still trapped, with additional tools and machinery ordered. The NCA is assessing adjacent buildings for safety, as they pose a danger to the rescue operations. All buildings in Kisii Town will be assessed to ensure their safety, and contractors are warned against violating construction procedures.

Bunch of idiots in congress who don't care. We are losing our forests and animals and it just so sad.	A new study reveals that human-induced climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires in the western United States over the past 30 years. The study shows that heightened temperatures and increased aridity since 1984 have caused fires to spread across an additional 16,000 square miles, an area larger than Massachusetts and Connecticut combined. The authors warn that further warming will exponentially increase fire activity in the coming decades. The study also highlights the role of climate change in exacerbating the recent California drought and the rise in fire incidents. Factors such as a natural climate oscillation and firefighting practices have also contributed to the increase in fires. The researchers emphasize the need to prepare for larger fire years due to climate change.

The rise in violence was driven by an increase in the murders of black men and an increase in gun murders. The number of firearm murders increased by roughly 1,500, while knife murders dropped slightly. The percentage of murders committed with guns increased to 71.5%. Despite the increase in murders, overall crime rates did not increase substantially. The attorney general mentioned the overall increase in violent crime but did not mention the increase in murders. A third of the murder increase was driven by ten larger cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Black men and women face less violence today than in the early 1990s. In a separate incident, two New Jersey Transit buses crashed in the Lincoln Tunnel, injuring as many as 44 people.

According to new government data, the rate of suicide deaths among children aged 10 to 14 has doubled since 2007. However, deaths from motor vehicle traffic and homicide have decreased over the same time period. Younger children may attempt suicide impulsively due to bad relationships with family and friends, while older children may do so because of relationship issues. Warning signs for suicide in children include increased sadness, irritability, anger, loss of interest in friends or activities, and saying mean or derogatory things. It is important for parents to talk to their children and listen to their feelings. There is limited research on suicide in children, and experts hope that the report will raise awareness and lead to more prevention efforts.

"The Great Barrier Reef, although severely damaged, is not completely dead. It is currently on ""life support"" due to coral bleaching. The reef is home to numerous species and is considered the world's largest living thing. Preliminary findings show that 22% of its coral has died from the bleaching event. Climate change is the main cause of coral bleaching, as it leads to the expulsion of algae from the corals. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is conducting surveys to assess the impact of the bleaching. While scientists have expressed concerns about the reef's future, it is not beyond saving. The reef supports 70,000 jobs in reef tourism, and large sections of it are still in reasonable shape. The focus should be on better protecting the reef rather than giving up on it."

The vaquita, the most endangered marine mammal on Earth, is facing extinction due to gill net fishing and the illegal trade of totoaba. Urgent conservation measures were approved to protect the vaquita, including a permanent ban on gill net fishing and efforts to crack down on the totoaba trade. However, experts argue that these measures are not enough to save the species. The current plan neglects local livelihoods, fails to involve local fishermen in designing a sustainable management plan, and does not adequately address the totoaba trade. The ban on gill nets is seen as a step forward, but more interventions are needed to ensure the vaquita's recovery. This case highlights the challenges and complexities of endangered species conservation. Conservation efforts often come too late or lack the thoroughness needed to make a lasting impact. A long-term vision and proactive action are necessary to effectively conserve species and natural resources.

A survey conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA) found that 52% of Americans consider the 2016 Presidential Election to be a significant source of stress. This stress is not limited to any particular political party and is exacerbated by social media posts, which can range from factual to inflammatory. Additionally, 38% of adults say that cultural and political discussions on social media cause them stress. The APA has provided a list of do's and don'ts for reading and reacting to election news. The stress trend is expected to continue until mid-November, as more people rely on online sources for news. While cable TV news remains the top source of election news, more millennials are turning to alternative sources for information.

Flint looked terrible and I can't imagine those contaminants are good for anyone's health, even if the FDA says they're ""acceptable."""	A new report by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) reveals that over 18 million Americans are supplied with drinking water that violates federal laws on lead content. The report states that the water crisis in Flint, Michigan is not an isolated incident, and that violations of national rules protecting against lead contamination are widespread. The NRDC's analysis of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows that 5,363 water systems, serving more than 18 million people, breached the federal Lead and Copper Rule in 2015. These violations include inadequate testing for lead and insufficient treatment to prevent lead from leaching into the water supply. The violations occurred in almost every state, with 1,110 community water utilities providing water that exceeded the EPA's actionable limit for lead. Despite the widespread failure of water suppliers, very few were punished by the EPA last year. Of the over 8,000 violations, enforcement action was only taken against 11% of cases, and penalties were sought for just 3% of violations. The EPA has acknowledged the challenges in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule and has intensified work with state drinking water programs. However, a revised rule will not be implemented until 2017 at the earliest. The NRDC emphasizes that unsafe drinking water is a national problem that requires a national solution. The failure of the system to detect violations is highlighted by the fact that Flint was not considered in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule last year, despite the well-known water crisis. The CDC has reported that lead levels in the blood of Flint children significantly increased after the city switched its water supply. The NRDC also revealed that water utilities often manipulate test results to downplay lead levels. The Guardian has reported that at least 33 US cities have used methods to mask the true level of lead in water tests. The report raises concerns about the extent of the issue and calls for a coordinated effort at all levels to prevent future crises.

Women have expressed feeling gross and objectified by his comments, and even trauma victims have been distressed by his behavior. Trump's defense that his words are ""just words"" or ""locker room talk"" does not render them harmless, as rude language can impair cognition and lead to less creative thinking. Uncivil political discourse, especially in a presidential debate, undermines trust in government and discourages women from running for office. Discriminatory speech has negative consequences for women, leading to anger, depression, and lower self-esteem. Different types of discrimination can compound each other, with women of color experiencing even greater harm. Trump's candidacy exposes the bleak state of gender relations in the US and raises questions about how sexism will be taken seriously in the future."

The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has called for large-scale, long-term investment in Somalia to ensure the successful repatriation of Somali refugees from the Dadaab camp in Kenya. The Kenyan government plans to close the camp by November 30th and has accepted a request to extend the deadline by six months. However, the IRC warns that deferring the closure will not address the refugees' concerns about violence, displacement, and gender-based violence in Somalia. The IRC emphasizes the need for support and integration programs for refugees, as well as investment in Somalia to provide earning opportunities.

At least 239 migrants are believed to have drowned in two shipwrecks off the coast of Libya this week, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Survivor accounts suggest that two overcrowded boats broke up just off the Libyan coast on Wednesday. The 31 survivors were taken to the Italian island of Lampedusa. If true, these shipwrecks bring the toll of dead and missing in the Mediterranean to 4,220 this year, the highest on record. Most of the migrants appear to have come from sub-Saharan Africa. The European Union is conducting a search-and-rescue operation in the western Mediterranean, but the focus remains on deterrence rather than protection. The shifting migration patterns have been a boon to smugglers, as demand has increased across the trickier North African route.

A new study from Umeå University in Sweden found that high rates of air pollution are linked to poorer psychiatric health in children and adolescents. The researchers examined register-based data on individuals under 18 from different regions in Sweden and found that air pollution levels do impact psychiatric diagnoses in young people. The risk of having at least one psychiatric diagnosis increased with a 10 microgram per cubic meter increase in nitrogen dioxide levels in the air. Nitrogen dioxide is a harmful air pollutant that results from road traffic and fossil fuel use. Long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide has been associated with reduced lung function, respiratory problems, and increased allergy rates.

Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans took to the streets in Seoul for the second consecutive weekend, demanding the resignation of President Park Geun-hye. The protests were sparked by Park's admission that she shared classified information with someone lacking security clearance. The demonstrations, which included families, students, and union members, were some of the largest anti-government protests in decades. Four officers and 26 protesters were injured during the protests. Park's spokesman stated that she realizes the seriousness of the situation and is considering ways to normalize affairs. Protesters are calling for Park's resignation due to feelings of betrayal and frustration with her leadership. The protests also stem from other incidents, such as the Sewol ferry sinking. Despite roadblocks, protesters attempted to march to the presidential palace. The demonstrations will continue until there are answers and a resolution to the political turmoil.

At a global wildlife summit, a bid to provide the highest level of international legal protection to all African elephants was defeated. However, new measures were passed to add vital protection for elephants, including the closure of legal ivory markets within nations and tougher measures to deal with nations failing to control poached ivory. The debate over elephant poaching has divided African countries, with some arguing that making money from ivory sales and trophy hunting is necessary for protection, while others believe that poaching and the illegal ivory trade pose the greatest threat. Most African elephants already have the highest level of international legal protection, but elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Botswana have a lower level of protection. A proposal to upgrade these populations to the highest level of protection was defeated. The EU and some scientific and conservation groups opposed the upgrade, arguing that it did not meet the biological criteria. The issue of cutting the demand for ivory and better enforcement against poachers were highlighted as key solutions.

It also mentioned some stories of horrible sexual abuse and misconduct by the boatmen working at the Grand Canyon river district.	A new study suggesting that Earth could be doomed to warming of up to 13 degrees Fahrenheit is being dismissed as flawed by climate scientists. The study, published in Nature, offers a reconstruction of global sea-surface temperatures for the past two million years. However, several top scientists argue that the author's conclusions about catastrophic temperature rise are not supported by the data. They claim that the study's author made a fundamental mistake in her analysis. Other scientists also criticize the study for extrapolating from past ice ages to the present climate. NASA's chief climate scientist states that if greenhouse gas levels stay the same, temperatures may rise an additional 0.5 to 1 degree Celsius, not 7 degrees. The study's author defends her work, stating that it shows a close relationship between temperature and greenhouse gases. However, critics argue that her method is not the way to determine the Earth's sensitivity to CO2. The question of how sensitive Earth's climate will be to CO2 emissions remains open. In a separate article, a congressional committee reveals that sexual harassment and bullying among National Park Service employees at iconic parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone has been pervasive and ongoing for years.

Dear friend, I have just read a very interesting article about the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and the people who are perpetrating it. The US is responsible for a large amount of the crude oil exports out of the Amazon, which is causing great amounts of destruction to the forest's ecosystem.	"A new report by environmental group Amazon Watch reveals that the United States is driving the destruction of the Amazon rainforest by importing crude oil from the region. American refineries processed over 230,000 barrels of Amazon crude oil per day last year, with California alone refining an average of 170,978 barrels per day. The expansion of oil drilling in the Amazon poses a serious threat to the region, with proposed oil and gas fields covering an area larger than Texas. The destruction of the Amazon rainforest releases greenhouse gases and puts indigenous communities and biodiversity at risk. Ecuador's state oil company recently started drilling near the biologically rich Yasuni national park. Indigenous communities are at risk of pollution, displacement, and deadly illnesses. Amazon Watch is calling for a reduction in Amazon crude imports and the establishment of ""no go zones"" in decision making."

Crapser has spent 37 of his 41 years in the United States and has a family there. However, he is being held in an immigration detention center and will be deported as soon as the necessary arrangements are made. Crapser's life in the United States has been difficult, including being abandoned by his adoptive parents and experiencing abuse in subsequent foster homes. He has also had a criminal record, which makes him eligible for deportation. The deportation is a result of his adoptive parents and the adoption agency failing to register him for U.S. citizenship. Many intercountry adoptees face this issue, and Congress is currently considering a bill that would grant citizenship to all children adopted by U.S. citizens. Crapser hopes that the bill will pass, but it will be too late for him. The Adoptee Rights Campaign and others find his deportation appalling and are urging the community to call members of Congress to support a legislative fix.

"A study has found that projected climate change by 2070 will occur too quickly for grass species, including wheat, corn, rice, and sorghum, to adapt. This poses a risk to the world's ability to grow enough food, as these species provide almost half of the calories consumed by humans. The grass family is not only important for diets but also for global biodiversity and ecosystems. The study compared the rates of climate change niche change in grass species with projected climate change and found a significant difference. This suggests that many grass species may disappear from certain locations. While the study did not focus on food security, it highlights the potential problems for farmers growing food crops. However, there is ongoing research to develop ""climate-proof"" food crops using wild relatives of domesticated species. Unfortunately, these wild relatives are also at risk from climate change."

The bodies are believed to have been buried as recently as October, just before the US-backed forces began their assault on Mosul. The grave was visited by Human Rights Watch, who found four exposed corpses and piles of rubbish covering other bodies. Witnesses reported that ISIS rounded up around 2,000 people from the area and forced them to head towards Mosul, separating the former policemen and driving them away.

Scientists have found that the method used by the U.S. poultry industry to stun chickens before slaughter does not consistently render them unconscious. This means that a significant number of chickens likely experience intense suffering when they are killed. The lack of regulations governing the humane slaughter of chickens in the U.S. has allowed poultry companies to prioritize meat quality over ensuring that chickens are reliably stunned. Animal protection groups are pressuring companies to phase out the use of electric water-baths and adopt alternative methods, such as controlled atmosphere killing. Gas stunning systems are considered more humane and produce better meat quality. The current process of slaughtering chickens also causes them stress and pain, with many experiencing broken bones and wing damage. The U.S. Agriculture Department estimates that hundreds of thousands of birds are unintentionally boiled alive each year. Animal welfare groups are campaigning to improve conditions for broiler chickens and some companies, like Perdue Farms, have pledged to install gas stunning systems in their facilities.

The Kenyan government has deported a senior South Sudan opposition member, James Gatdet Dak, despite threats against him. This comes after the UN dismissed the Kenyan general in charge of the peacekeeping force in South Sudan for failing to protect civilians during recent violence. Dak, a spokesman for the main South Sudanese rebel group, expressed support for the removal of the Kenyan top officer in the UN mission in South Sudan in a Facebook post. The conflict in South Sudan has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and displacement of hundreds of thousands. Human rights experts warn that Dak is at risk in South Sudan. Kenya has threatened to withdraw its peacekeeping troops from South Sudan following the dismissal of their general. The row between the UN and the Kenyan government highlights the tense relations between the two.

A federal report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has concluded that the barrier separating humans and primates at the Cincinnati Zoo was not in compliance with standards for housing primates when a child fell into the gorilla exhibit in May. The report issued a critical citation because the barrier failed and caused harm to an animal. However, before the incident, the zoo had not been cited for shortcomings with the barrier during previous inspections. The zoo has since updated the barrier and is now in compliance with federal standards. The family of the child who entered the enclosure has stated that they do not want to pursue legal action against the zoo. The USDA has issued 10 citations at the zoo in the last three years, but none were related to the gorilla exhibit. The Cincinnati Zoo officials have reaffirmed their commitment to the well-being of the animals and the safety of visitors. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) has stated that the zoo meets their standards related to barriers.

So I officially am against having goldfish as pets and am going to warn everyone I know that unless they want to destroy their local rivers they should never throw goldfish in their or flush them down the toilet."	Goldfish that are released into the wild can become invasive and cause serious ecological damage. In Australia's Vasse River, goldfish have thrived and grown to large sizes, with some reaching 16 inches and four pounds. Goldfish invasions have also been reported in other places like Nevada, Colorado, and Alberta. The growth rate of goldfish in the Vasse River is the fastest known in the world. The problem with goldfish invasions stems from a disconnect between how people view goldfish as cute pets and their behavior in the wild. Goldfish are capable of rapid reproduction, uprooting vegetation, disturbing sediment, and transmitting diseases and parasites. Eradicating goldfish is difficult once they are established. Recent research has shown that goldfish are long-distance swimmers and migrate to spawn. Understanding goldfish behavior can help inform management strategies. It is crucial for pet owners to responsibly dispose of unwanted fish to prevent further invasions. Flushing fish down the toilet is not recommended.

Inmates have no say in who they share a cell with, even if the cellmate has a violent history or severe mental illness. If they refuse a cellmate, they are placed in restraints for hours or days. Restraints are also used as punishment for inmates who break rules or get into fights. The conditions in the Special Management Unit (SMU) at Lewisburg are harsh, with inmates spending nearly 24 hours a day in small cells with little room to move. In 2014 and 2015, there were 228 in-cell fights and assaults at Lewisburg, resulting in injuries and even deaths. The use of restraints at Lewisburg has been criticized by inmates, lawyers, and auditors, but the Bureau of Prisons denies any mistreatment. Changes have been made to the SMU, but the use of restraints remains unchanged. Inmates are left with few options: accept a violent cellmate or be restrained.

It occurs when a person is awake and conscious but unable to move, except for their eyes. Sleep paralysis often involves nightmares or hallucinations and can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The causes of sleep paralysis are not fully understood, but stress and disruptions to sleep, such as alcohol or caffeine, can increase the risk. It can also be a symptom of other sleep disorders and mental health conditions. Kendall Jenner discussed her struggles with sleep paralysis, which may be linked to her anxiety and jet lag. Sleep paralysis is more common in people with mental health problems and young adults. For most people, it is not a chronic condition, but some individuals experience recurrent episodes. Practicing good sleep behaviors, such as avoiding alcohol and caffeine and sleeping on your side, can help prevent sleep paralysis. If it becomes a problem, a specialist may be able to prescribe medications to suppress REM sleep and alleviate symptoms.

A suspected serial killer in Anchorage, Alaska was stopped by a police officer who was responding to a theft complaint. The officer, Arn Salao, was shot multiple times by the suspect, James Dale Ritchie, but managed to return fire and fight off his assailant. Another officer arrived at the scene and also fired at Ritchie, killing him. Ballistics tests revealed that the gun Ritchie used was the same one used in five other homicides in Anchorage in 2016. Ritchie had prior arrests for drugs and burglary and had recently returned to Alaska from West Virginia. Two of the victims linked to Ritchie's gun were identified as Jason Netter Sr. and Brianna Foisy, who were found dead in July. Another two victims, Bryant De Husson and Kevin Schuyler Turner, were found dead in August. The motive behind the killings is unknown, and it is unclear if Ritchie knew any of the victims. The police believe that the chance encounter between Officer Salao and Ritchie may have saved countless lives. Two other unsolved double homicides in Anchorage have not been linked to Ritchie.

Justin Ross Harris, a man from Georgia, is on trial for leaving his infant son to die in a hot car. Prosecutors argue that Harris left his son in the car for seven hours because he was pursuing extramarital affairs. Defense attorneys admit Harris's philandering but argue that his son's death was a tragic accident. The fate of Harris is now in the hands of the jurors. The trial has gained significant publicity, leading to the proceedings being moved 300 miles away. Harris faces charges of malice murder, felony murder, and cruelty to children. The prosecution emphasized Harris's illicit chats with women, including underage girls, on the day of his son's death. The defense argues that Harris's sexual behavior is unrelated to the death. The prosecution highlighted the position of the car seat as evidence that Harris could see his son. The defense claims that the investigation was biased and misled the jurors.

The cave is known for its allure and is a popular destination for experienced divers. However, it is also considered dangerous, and signs warn divers of the risks. The area had been off-limits for divers from 1999 to 2003. Only highly trained divers should attempt to dive there, as even skilled divers can be affected at dangerous depths. The cause of death has not been disclosed, and autopsy results are pending.

The Pentagon identified the dead US service members and expressed condolences. The incident occurred on the same day as a Taliban mortar attack that killed seven people attending a wedding party. In April, the Pentagon announced disciplinary action for a fatal US strike on a Kunduz hospital in 2015. The strike was deemed unintentional human error and equipment failure, rather than a war crime.

"The Trump campaign has been pursuing a strategy of publicly courting black voters while privately seeking to depress their turnout, according to a BusinessWeek article. The campaign has three major voter suppression operations targeting idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. These operations include placing negative ads on select African American radio stations and using Facebook ""dark posts"" to deliver targeted messages. The campaign believes that depressing Clinton's vote total among these groups will benefit Trump. However, there is evidence that negative campaigning does not significantly depress voter turnout. Trump's approach to African Americans has been seen as insincere, with many of his events aimed at them taking place in predominantly white areas. As a result, Trump's polling among African Americans is poor, with him trailing Clinton by a large margin. While Trump's advisors believe that he doesn't need black votes to win, future Republican candidates will, and the campaign's efforts to suppress black voter turnout may harm the party's relationship with this demographic for years to come."

Two divers, Patrick Peacock and Chris Rittenmeyer, were found dead in the Eagle's Nest cave dive area in Western Florida. They had gone diving with a third man who reported them missing. The bodies were found the next day in a dangerous area of the cave system. The cave is known for its allure and is a popular destination for experienced divers. However, it is also considered dangerous, and signs warn divers of the risks. The area had been off-limits for divers from 1999 to 2003. Only highly trained divers should attempt to dive there, as even skilled divers can be affected at dangerous depths. The cause of death has not been disclosed, and autopsy results are pending. Some people have called for the area to be closed again, while others argue that people should be allowed to dive there if they have the necessary training and experience. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission did not comment on whether the site might be closed.

Islamic State fighters launched a series of car bomb attacks in northern Syria as U.S.-backed forces began their push to retake Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State. The operation aims to isolate Raqqa and cut off supply routes for the militants. The car bomb attacks were a preview of the fierce battle that lies ahead. The U.S.-led coalition conducted airstrikes in support of the offensive. However, the U.S. also sought to calm Turkey, which is concerned about the increased influence of Kurdish groups in the region. The Obama administration faces the challenge of balancing its relationship with Turkey and the Syrian Kurdish forces it supports. Talks were held to secure Turkish support for the operation and to reassure Ankara that the offensive would not benefit Syrian Kurds.

Residents in war-ravaged eastern Aleppo received a text message warning them to evacuate within 24 hours before a planned assault. The message, likely sent by the Syrian government, also gave rebels an ultimatum to surrender or be killed. While there were no reports of bombardment by Monday afternoon, witnesses spotted fighter jets in the city. Russian warplanes have been backing the regime with airstrikes since September, causing destruction in Aleppo. The UN warned that the city is on the brink of starvation and lacks essential supplies. Turkey has been carrying out airstrikes in northern Syria to support the Free Syrian Army and plans to move on to Manbij after liberating al-Bab from ISIS. This move has stirred sectarian tensions and complicated efforts to free Syrian cities from ISIS control. Turkey considers some Kurdish militia groups as terrorists, while the US supports and arms them. The conflict between the US and Russia over which groups to target in Syria further complicates the situation.

Just aboloshing three types of currency has hurt them so much. Could you imagine if one day the 10 and 20 dollar bills were no longer acceptable would be complete chaos."	Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended his surprise ban on most currency in circulation in India, which has caused chaos and inconvenience for millions of people. Modi argued that the ban was necessary to fight corruption and reduce the use of unaccounted-for cash in the country. However, opposition leaders and many citizens have criticized the move, as people have faced long lines at banks and ATMs, and many machines have run out of cash. Despite the hardships, some individuals expressed support for the ban, believing that it will ultimately benefit the nation. The transition to new currency notes has been complicated by the fact that many ATMs are not working and cannot dispense the new notes. The Finance Ministry reported that Indians have deposited about $45 billion in banned currency notes since the policy began, while banks and ATMs have given out $7.5 billion in new currency notes. The ban has had a significant impact on businesses, with sales falling and customers unable to pay with cash. While some individuals believe the ban is necessary, others argue that it is causing unnecessary suffering for the poor and that the real black money is hidden in Swiss bank accounts.

Arbitrary security measures and restrictions on volunteers further isolate the children and cut off their access to communication and legal assistance. Many refugees are sleeping outside in the cold and rain, exposed to danger. Despite the desperate conditions, volunteers continue to provide support. Charities received notice that children in the container camp will be transferred to accommodation centers across France, but there are no guarantees and the process may take time. It is crucial for charities to ensure that refugees in France receive better care.

India has relocated thousands of people from the border area, and there have been other repercussions, such as a Bollywood director refusing to hire Pakistani actors.

The campaign gained support online through a trending Twitter hashtag. Women in Saudi Arabia must obtain permission from a male relative for activities such as traveling, working, studying, and even leaving the country. The petition was delivered to the government, and the activists are awaiting a response. The male guardianship system also affects women's ability to rent a flat, seek medical treatment, or file a legal claim. The campaign has received an incredible response, with hundreds of women bombarding the Saudi King's office with telegrams supporting the cause. However, there is opposition from some Saudi women who argue for reforming the system. The activists are demanding that women be treated as full citizens and that an age between 18 and 21 be designated as the point at which a woman is considered an adult. There has been no official response to the petition yet.

At least 800,000 people urgently need food, but there is not enough aid reaching the affected areas. Truckloads of food and medical supplies have been looted, and desperate crowds have clashed with police. The storm destroyed homes, crops, and livestock, leaving many without shelter or a means to survive. Cholera outbreaks are also occurring due to contaminated water supplies. The United Nations has only raised one-third of the emergency funding needed to help the affected population. The Haitian government, along with international relief organizations, is coordinating efforts to provide assistance, but political obstacles and the upcoming elections pose challenges. The situation is dire, with people sleeping under trees and lacking basic necessities. The destruction is so severe that some remote mountain villages may not receive aid until the end of November.

The demand for rhino horns, which are used in traditional medicine and high-end ornaments, has led to a spike in poaching. The South African government has declared rhino poaching a ""national priority crime"" and has implemented initiatives to combat the problem. Private rhino owners have spent millions of dollars on security measures, but the fight against poaching remains challenging.

Lead contamination in a housing project in South Los Angeles is putting 300 children at risk of lead poisoning. Elevated blood lead levels have been recorded in the children, with some levels well above the CDC threshold. The former industrial site near the housing project has been found to have elevated lead and arsenic levels. The proposed lowering of the lead detection level for federal cleanup action could affect millions of subsidized and public housing units. The site has been cleaned up, but residents are concerned about the impact of planned demolition. Lead levels have also been found in nearby schools, but authorities claim they are not a risk to human health. The housing project also faces other pollution issues, including a trichloroethylene plume in the groundwater and a breach in an underground oil pipeline. Soil tests conducted by a nonprofit organization found that over 50% of the samples taken exceeded the cleanup threshold. The situation has been described as a case of environmental racism.

Protests erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black man was fatally shot by a police officer. Around 16 police officers were injured during clashes with protesters, who looted trucks and set fire to cargo on a highway. The shooting occurred when officers were trying to serve an arrest warrant, claiming that the man posed a deadly threat. However, the man's family disputes this, stating that he was unarmed and holding a book. The incident has reignited scrutiny of the police department, which previously faced controversy over the shooting of an unarmed black man.

The world's wildlife trade policy body, CITES, is calling for better treatment and tracking of illegally traded animals that are confiscated by authorities. Between 2010 and 2014, over 60,000 wild creatures were seized, with a fifth of them being threatened species. However, wildlife advocates argue that animals often suffer after being confiscated, as they are sometimes sent to inadequate facilities, returned to traffickers, or released back into the wild where they can spread diseases. CITES guidelines state that confiscated animals should be sent back to the exporting country, a designated rescue center, or other appropriate places, with humane treatment ensured. However, this doesn't always happen due to cost, impracticality, or lack of designated rescue centers. CITES member countries have agreed to distribute a questionnaire to gather information on how nations deal with confiscated animals, and Humane Society International has offered recommendations on setting up rescue centers.

The economic crisis in Venezuela has led to a shortage of food, affecting both people and animals. Around 50 animals at Caricuao Zoo have starved in the last six months due to the rising cost of food caused by the economic downturn. The country's inability to import food and other necessities, along with skyrocketing inflation, has led to widespread hunger. Zoo staff have resorted to feeding carnivorous animals fruits and vegetables, and even slaughtered horses. The malnourishment of animals can have long-lasting health effects, including psychological issues. Other zoos in Venezuela are also struggling to feed their animals and are seeking donations. The situation in Venezuela is not unique, as animals in other countries, such as Gaza and Yemen, are also suffering due to poor social climates and conflicts. Animal rights organizations are working to address these issues and provide assistance to the affected animals.

A deadly outbreak of bloodstream infections in Wisconsin has left health officials puzzled. The infections, caused by a species of bacteria called Elizabethkingia anophelis, have killed 15 people and sickened 33 others. The microbe is resistant to common antibiotics, making treatment difficult. The outbreak is unusual because the bacteria is typically found in hospitals, but many of the infected individuals have not had recent contact with healthcare facilities. Investigators are testing various products for contamination as a possible source. The outbreak is challenging to understand as little is known about Elizabethkingia. The bacteria is commonly found in soil and mosquitoes, and it thrives in moist biofilms. Previous outbreaks have been linked to contaminated taps in hospitals. The current outbreak is the first reported of this particular species of Elizabethkingia. Officials believe it is unlikely that the contamination comes from tap or groundwater, but the source remains unknown.

They have had to pay for bottled water in addition to their tainted tap water. However, legislation based on the ""human right to water"" is now being implemented, and Matheny Tract will be the first community to receive clean water under this law. Similar legislation has been introduced in Michigan, but is still stuck in committee. The issue of water inequality in rural communities has been brought to the forefront by the state's record-breaking drought. Many small rural systems in California have contaminated water, affecting an estimated 160,000 people. These communities often lack public investment and are overlooked by their local governments. The right to water is seen as a fundamental human right, and California's legislation is seen as a step towards addressing water inequality. The state has also introduced a publicly accessible database on water systems that are out of compliance. Matheny Tract is scheduled to receive clean water on June 1, marking a significant improvement for the community."

ISIS has executed 232 people near Mosul and taken tens of thousands as human shields against advancing Iraqi forces, according to the United Nations. The terror group carried out mass killings as punishment for defying its orders. Since October 17, ISIS has taken tens of thousands of men, women, and children from the outskirts of Mosul into the city, intending to use them as human shields. Iraqi forces have launched an operation to cut ISIS supply lines west of Mosul. Reports indicate that ISIS has abducted thousands of families from various areas. The use of human shields is a violation of international humanitarian law. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned ISIS's strategy and urged those fighting ISIS not to carry out revenge attacks. The Mosul operation has already displaced thousands of people, and camps have been set up to accommodate them. Civilians continue to flee despite the risks involved.

"The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, was known to the FBI for years but was not considered a security threat. This highlights the challenge of identifying ""lone wolf"" terrorists who are not connected to established extremist groups. The FBI retains data on individuals even after determining they are not a threat, raising concerns about privacy rights. The shooting has sparked debate about whether individuals interviewed by the FBI should be able to purchase guns or be under continued surveillance. The FBI interviewed Mateen multiple times but was unable to find any suspicious ties. The bureau is allowed to keep data on individuals even after closing investigations, which has raised concerns about privacy. Trust between local communities and the government is crucial in identifying domestic lone-wolf extremists before they commit acts of terrorism. The difficulty in identifying individuals like Mateen highlights the lack of a profile for potential terrorists."

However, no damage was reported at the oil terminal, which is one of the world's largest. This was the third earthquake in Oklahoma this year with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater. No major injuries were reported, but there were cracks, fallen bricks, and facades damaged. The earthquake was centered 1 mile west of Cushing and occurred near a previous magnitude 4.3 quake. Aftershocks were feared, and parts of the city were cordoned off. An assisted living community was evacuated, and the Cushing Public School District canceled classes. Highways and bridges within a 15-mile radius of the epicenter were undamaged. The quake was felt as far away as Iowa, Illinois, and Texas.

A priest who was abducted in Mexico has been found alive but with signs of torture. This incident brings attention to the attacks on priests in Mexico, with two others being found shot to death after being kidnapped.

Two girls in Myanmar who were kept prisoner and tortured for five years in a tailor shop have sparked outrage and an investigation. The police had previously refused to get involved despite pleas from the girls' families. The girls, who were sent to work in the shop at the ages of 11 and 12, were denied contact with their parents, not paid, and subjected to abuse. The case highlights the issue of child slavery in Myanmar, where at least a million children are forced to give up education and work.

The United Nations is so spineless of an organization they are just forced to watch as hundred of people are killed.	The United Nations has expressed concern over the sharp increase in civilian casualties in Yemen since peace talks collapsed last month. The majority of these casualties were caused by airstrikes from a coalition led by Saudi Arabia. At least 329 civilians have been killed and 426 injured since the beginning of August. Saudi Arabia and its allies are trying to prevent an international investigation into possible war crimes. The United States and Britain, major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia, are finding it harder to ignore the bloodshed. The most recent example of the carnage was an airstrike on a market and residential area in Hodeidah, which killed at least 26 civilians. The United Nations has documented numerous attacks on civilian facilities by both coalition and rebel forces. Doctors Without Borders has pulled staff members out of six hospitals in Yemen after coalition planes bombed a facility. The United Nations has also expressed concern over the blockade of the city of Taiz, which has left residents critically short of food and water. The majority of civilian casualties have been caused by the Saudi-led coalition, according to a report to the Human Rights Council. Saudi Arabia and President Hadi's government have condemned the report as biased and have proposed a Yemeni commission to investigate human rights violations. Rights groups argue that a national body lacks expertise and that its reporting falls short of international standards. The European Union has drafted a competing resolution calling for a United Nations mission to Yemen. The Council will decide how to proceed after a week of diplomatic negotiations. President Hadi accused Iran of blocking the path towards peace in Yemen.

"More survivors of the Leviathan II tragedy, in which a whale-watching boat capsized and killed six people, have filed a lawsuit against the tour operator. The lawsuit describes the terrifying moments after the boat capsized, with the ship pitching and rolling in significant waves caused by a shallow reef. The captain had stopped the boat to view sea lions when a swell rose into a larger wave, causing the vessel to heel over. One of the plaintiffs, Robert Goodfellow, was submerged beneath the sea for a considerable period of time before swimming to the surface. Another plaintiff, Marya Levin, pushed a cushion towards two other passengers who were in danger of being struck by rotating propellers. Goodfellow and Levin eventually reached a lifeboat and are now seeking damages from the tour operator for physical, mental, and emotional trauma. Other survivors have also filed lawsuits, including one detailing their attempts to escape the sinking ship and a class-action suit citing post-traumatic stress disorder.

These fires have burned over 107,000 acres, with 37 fires covering at least 100 acres each. Arson is suspected in some cases. The fires have caused a hazy pall over northern Georgia, and officials have warned of unhealthy air quality. State firefighters are working to contain the fires and have urged people to avoid starting new ones. The drought has also affected water levels, with a popular state park's main attraction reduced to a trickle.

Kim Kardashian West was held at gunpoint in a robbery in Paris, where a group of men stole millions of dollars' worth of jewelry. The concierge, Abdulrahman, revealed that the robbers initially wanted money, not jewels. There was speculation that a diamond ring Kardashian West showed off on social media prompted the heist, but Abdulrahman clarified that the robber was only interested in money. After giving him the ring, the thief pocketed it and continued to demand money. Some jewels and gold were lost because the thief left the bag open. The police are still investigating, but no arrests have been made. Kardashian West has reduced her social media presence and public outings since the incident.

Germany, which took in more asylum seekers than the rest of Europe combined, is facing the challenge of deciding who gets to stay. Syrians and Iraqis are almost guaranteed sanctuary, while Nigerians and Pakistanis are more likely to have their claims rejected. Even Syrians are increasingly falling short of winning full refugee status. Critics argue that asylum officials are turning a deaf ear to genuine petitions from asylum seekers arriving from countries outside the Middle East war zones. The German government is increasingly targeting migrants deemed ineligible for protection and is enforcing deportation more strictly. The system is flawed, with many appeals against the Federal Office's decisions and concerns about inexperienced decision-makers and declining interpreter quality.

Either Way this article about how ""doctors don't take fat people seriously' is as long as these fatties are wide, have fun reading it."	The healthcare system in the United States is ill-prepared to treat obese patients, with doctors often unwilling to look past their weight and provide proper care. Obese patients face difficulties ranging from inadequate equipment to biased attitudes from healthcare providers. Doctors may spend less time with obese patients, fail to refer them for diagnostic tests, and attribute symptoms to their weight without investigating other causes. The lack of appropriate medical care for obese patients extends to treatments, with drug doses often not calibrated for obese patients and surgeons refusing to perform joint replacements unless the patient loses weight. The situation is further complicated by the fear of medical professionals of being penalized for complications and poor outcomes. The article also discusses the challenges faced by doctors and therapists in providing medical care to transgender patients due to limited knowledge and bias. The Mexican government's investigation into the disappearance of 43 college students in 2014 remains unsolved, leading many to question its ability and willingness to find answers.

Aiden Webb, a 22-year-old rock climber from Norfolk, died while attempting to scale Vietnam's tallest mountain, Mount Fansipan. His body was found six days after he set off alone for the climb. His girlfriend, Bluebell Baughan, had pleaded with him to get help after he got lost on the mountain. Webb slipped, injured himself, and got lost off the main trail due to a landslide. He refused Baughan's pleas to call for help and had to spend the night dressed only in shorts. In his last text, he asked Baughan to raise the alarm, but the message failed to get through. His body was eventually found in a stream, and local police concluded that he had drowned while unconscious. The cause of his death could not be ascertained due to embalming. Webb's parents described him as a joy to be around and expressed their close bond as a family.

Iraqi Christians who were brutalized by the Islamic State and betrayed by their neighbors doubt they will ever be able to return to Mosul. The advance of the Islamic State scattered religious and ethnic minorities in the area, and the future of the region will be defined by who decides to return. While some villagers express hope in rebuilding and staying, others believe the area is lost and will only get worse. Iraq's news media has been showing images of soldiers recapturing desecrated churches, implying that it will soon be safe for Christians to return. However, Christians have been leaving Iraq for years, and community leaders say it will be difficult to go back to Mosul due to the pain and threats they experienced. Many Christians who do return would likely only do so to sell their houses and leave.

Mexico's top economic officials tried to calm fears, stating that Mexico was in a strong economic position. The peso dropped in value after Trump's win appeared imminent.

"President Obama oversaw significant growth in federal spending to reduce inequality, but President-elect Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress are likely to undo these measures. Trump's proposed policies, such as building a border wall, deporting undocumented workers, and cutting taxes, could lead to financial panic and a possible recession. The repeal of Obamacare and the proposed tax cuts would disproportionately affect the poor, with millions potentially losing access to healthcare and the highest-income taxpayers benefiting the most. In order to balance the budget, the GOP would need to make significant spending cuts, which would likely impact assistance programs for the young and poor. Trump's vague plans make it unclear which specific policies would be eliminated, but House Speaker Paul Ryan's ""A Better Way"" plan provides some insight into potential cuts. Overall, Trump's presidency could make it much harder to be poor in America and represents a repudiation of Obama's economic policies."

Two men have been arrested in connection with the stabbing death of a partygoer in Manhattan. James Rackover, a surrogate son to celebrity jeweler Jeffrey Rackover, and Lawrence Dilione have been charged with hindering prosecution, tampering with evidence, and concealing a corpse. The victim, Joseph Comunale, was stabbed 15 times and his partially burned body was found buried under a foot of earth. The motive for the attack is still under investigation, but sources suggest it may have been triggered by Comunale rejecting sexual advances. The suspects attempted to bleach the victim's blood from his clothes and used gasoline to try to burn his body. The case has shocked friends of Jeffrey Rackover, who described James as the son he never had.

"Maia Sandu, a presidential candidate in Moldova, is facing criticism for being a single woman. Former President Vladimir Voronin, who is chairman of the communist party, stated that presidential candidates should be married and campaign with their spouses. He refused to even shake Sandu's hand, calling her a ""betrayal of family values"" and a ""national disgrace."" Bishop Marchel, a leader in the Moldovan Orthodox Church, also attacked Sandu, claiming that her attitude towards Christian morality diverges from normal principles. Sandu defended herself, stating that being a single woman is not a shame. Voronin also criticized Sandu's opponent, Igor Dodon, but implied that Dodon is a preferable choice. Sandu has campaigned on a pro-European Union platform, while Dodon aligns his views with those of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The presidential election in Moldova will have a runoff vote on November 13."

A deadly shooting occurred at a Starbucks in Las Vegas after a customer's card was declined. The suspect fired shots in the air and then at a customer, who later died. The incident was initially treated as a hostage situation, causing a delay in medical treatment. The suspect called the police and falsely described a different shooter. The suspect, a Hispanic man with a criminal history, was later detained and found to be in possession of a gun.

The shortage was caused by a leak in a pipeline that runs from Houston to New Jersey, resulting in over 300,000 gallons of gas being leaked. The states affected by the shortage include Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas. While prices have increased, they are still below $2.50 per gallon in many areas. The shortage has led to panic and frustration among drivers, with some gas stations completely running out of fuel. Efforts are being made to address the shortage, including repairs to the pipeline and alternative methods of transporting gasoline.

"Sharbat Gula, the Afghan woman known for her striking green eyes in a National Geographic cover photo, has been arrested in Pakistan for falsifying documents and staying illegally in the country. If convicted, she could face up to 14 years in jail or deportation. Last year, Gula was arrested on similar charges but was later released. Photographer Steve McCurry, who took the iconic photo, has expressed his objection to her arrest and is committed to helping her legally and financially. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) stated that they can only assist Gula if she registers as a refugee, but she falls under the category of ""undocumented migrants."" The arrest highlights the mounting pressure on Afghan refugees in Pakistan to return home, with over 370,000 Afghans being repatriated since July 1. Human Rights Watch has raised concerns about the situation, stating that millions of Afghans have sought shelter in Pakistan due to conflict and poverty in their own country."

A new study warns that if climate change continues, deserts in the Middle East will expand to the Mediterranean and even reach Southern Spain, transforming forests into barren lands. The study, published in the journal Science, used climate models and historical data to predict the changes in the Mediterranean if the Paris Agreement fails. Researchers found that when global warming hits 2 degrees, deserts would expand in Spain, the Near East, and North Africa. The impact of temperature changes on lands and people's lives could also affect global security. President Barack Obama has called for the development of clean energy resources to avoid conflicts and criticized climate change skeptics. He also suggested that droughts in Syria contributed to the civil war.

Jewish communities in the United States are grappling with fear, grief, and anger following Donald Trump's election as president. Synagogues across the country have held prayer and healing services to address these emotions. While Jews have not been directly insulted by Trump, they fear that his presidency will create a hostile environment for minority groups. The Jewish community is overwhelmingly liberal and Democratic, leading to a sense of alienation from their fellow Americans. However, they also recognize the need for understanding and reaching out to Trump supporters. Jews are urged to reflect on their own actions and allyship with other marginalized groups. This new era has brought about a struggle for Jews to understand Trump supporters while maintaining their own values and finding solidarity with others.

I'm just saddened by the times shown in the article that women would need to leave in each country to be equal to a man's pay still.	"Thousands of women in Iceland left work early to protest the gender wage gap. They gathered in Austurvollur square in Reykjavik, shouting ""Out"" to discrimination against women. The protest highlighted the 30% pay gap between men and women in Iceland. The demonstration aimed to bring attention to the issue and demand change. Despite Iceland's reputation as a gender-equal nation, progress on pay equity has been slow. The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap ranking shows that Iceland still has gaps in earned income and wages for similar work. The report also reveals that global progress towards economic parity between men and women has suffered setbacks in recent years. The gender pay gap persists due to various factors, including women entering less well-paid professions and the time it takes for employers' implicit gender biases to change. The protest in Iceland emphasizes the urgency of addressing the gender pay gap and the need for faster progress."
