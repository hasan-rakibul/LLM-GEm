Seems like so many tragic accidents have been happening lately. I just read another article about the tragic death of a father son that took place during a hike. The both of them fell off a cliff and died recently while exploring the outdoors. There was an attempt made to recover their bodies but the exact cause was not specified. Poor souls. I pray that their family may be given strength as they discover the tragedy.	A father and son tragically died after falling off a cliff during a hike near Shaver Lake in Fresno, California. Despite efforts by deputies, a helicopter power failure prevented them from reaching the hikers. A search-and-rescue crew will be sent out to recover the bodies.

This is definitely an upsetting thing that has happened. We like to think that when we go to a theme park, all the rides are completely safe and maintained well. But there is always a risk, however small, that something tragic could happen. Even in a safe environment like a well-maintained park, we need to keep up our guard and use good judgment.	Four people were killed in a river ride malfunction at Dreamworld, Australia's largest theme park. The incident occurred on the Thunder River Rapids Ride, a popular attraction that is considered tame and family-friendly. Two people were ejected from the raft, while the other two were trapped inside. The victims' identities have not been released, and authorities have not provided details about the injuries sustained. Witnesses reported seeing the ride flip and a girl being pulled from it before it overturned. Emergency services were unable to save the victims, and the park was closed for the day. The incident has deeply affected the staff and prompted an investigation by multiple agencies.	3.2

Although people may not agree with the current administration under Trump they can not falt or blame other for their personal beliefs. It is especially a shame when a mom will kick out their own child for mock voting is a manner that she find unfitting.	A mother in Fresno, Texas kicked her son out of the house after he voted for Donald Trump in a school mock election. The incident was captured on video and went viral. The mother made the child stand on a street corner with a sign explaining why he was kicked out. The case is not considered child abuse, and no charges have been filed.

If you have gone through war, gone through hell, you should expect that when you come home to the country that you have been fighting to protect that they will take care of you in some way instead of throwing you out into the cold and basically tell you good luck. It is heartbreaking to know people out there are in poverty, but especially to know that our war veterans are treated this way.	"The eldest generation in Russia, known as the ""children of the war,"" are living in poverty. Despite surviving World War II and other hardships, they are struggling to make ends meet on a meager pension. The falling ruble and rising prices have made it difficult for pensioners to afford basic necessities. Many have resorted to selling apples and relying on secondhand clothing and homegrown food. Medical care is also a challenge, as the cost of treatment is often too high. The government's response has been inadequate, offering a one-time payment instead of increasing pensions. Despite these difficulties, pensioners in Oryol have found solace in a DIY school for the elderly, where they can learn new skills and find companionship. However, they still long for a better quality of life and feel frustrated by the lack of support from the government."	6.5

I do not know why the United States of America will not be more proactive in helping this less fortunate country. A lot of people complain about Chavez, but that seems to be when the country was the most stable."	Venezuela is currently facing political turmoil as President Nicolas Maduro's version of chavismo has brought chaos to the country and turned voters against him. The opposition has been pushing for a recall referendum to remove Maduro from power, but the government has been delaying and suspending the process. Venezuelans have taken to the streets in protest, but security forces and government sympathizers have responded violently. The military and paramilitary groups continue to support Maduro, but there are signs of cultural differences and potential divisions within the military. The opposition is calling for dialogue and negotiations, but many see it as a stalling tactic. The situation in Venezuela is uncertain and the future remains unclear.	4.2

Russia has claimed that the UN aid convoy that was bombed in Syria on Monday night was escorted by terrorists, denying accusations that it was behind the attack. The convoy, which was delivering food aid to opposition-held parts of Aleppo, was hit shortly after the end of a ceasefire. The Russian defense ministry released drone footage showing a pickup truck carrying militants and a heavy mortar driving alongside the convoy before it was bombed. More than a dozen people were killed, including the director of the organization. The truce collapsed as leaders were gathered at the UN in New York to negotiate a longer-term peace plan. The US accused the Syrian government and Russia of violating the ceasefire, while Moscow accused the US-led coalition of aiding ISIS. The incident highlights the deep mistrust between the superpowers and the failure to achieve a lasting agreement to end the conflict.	6.5

A young male wolf, part of the Huckleberry pack in Washington state, was killed by a government sniper after traveling over 700 miles in search of a mate. The wolf had been saved from extermination as a pup in 2014. He was collared in February and survived the wolf-killing fields in Idaho before being shot near Wildlife Services in Montana.

The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted.

Protests erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black man was fatally shot by a police officer. Around 16 police officers were injured during clashes with protesters, who looted trucks and set fire to cargo on a highway. The shooting occurred when officers were trying to serve an arrest warrant, claiming that the man posed a deadly threat. However, the man's family disputes this, stating that he was unarmed and holding a book. The incident has reignited scrutiny of the police department, which previously faced controversy over the shooting of an unarmed black man. This shooting is the latest in a series of incidents that have sparked outrage and debate about race relations and law enforcement. The police department is currently conducting an investigation into the shooting.	3.2

I have never heard of sleep paralysis but it doesn't sound like a particularly dangerous disorder. We all undergo a state of unconsciousness during sleep where we dream and cannot control certain things in the dream. But this seems to be an extension of dreaming where your brain becomes out of synch with your body. I suspect this may something to do with stress and mental health problems	Sleep paralysis is a common sleep problem that affects around 8% of the population. It occurs when a person is awake and conscious but unable to move, except for their eyes. Sleep paralysis often involves nightmares or hallucinations and can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The causes of sleep paralysis are not fully understood, but stress and disruptions to sleep, such as alcohol or caffeine, can increase the risk. It can also be a symptom of other sleep disorders and mental health conditions. Kendall Jenner discussed her struggles with sleep paralysis, which may be linked to her anxiety and jet lag. Sleep paralysis is more common in people with mental health problems and young adults. For most people, it is not a chronic condition, but some individuals experience recurrent episodes. Practicing good sleep behaviors, such as avoiding alcohol and caffeine and sleeping on your side, can help prevent sleep paralysis. If it becomes a problem, a specialist may be able to prescribe medications to suppress REM sleep and alleviate symptoms.	3.2

Seven leaders of an armed militia who led a 41-day stand-off at a US federal wildlife refuge in Oregon have been acquitted of conspiracy and firearms charges. The occupation of the refuge, which began in January, was a protest against federal control of land. The defendants argued that they did not intend to prevent federal officers from going to work, and the jury was unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that they had. The acquittal has been seen as a victory for states' rights and a blow to the federal government. The case against a second group of defendants is due to go to trial in February.	4.2

A study identified 94 core ecological processes, of which 82% showed evidence of impact from climate change. These impacts range from shifts in species ranges and changes in phenology to disruptions at the genetic and ecosystem levels. Species are adapting to temperature extremes, with changes in physiology and morphology. Changes in phenology, abundance, and distribution of species have also been observed. These impacts have implications for food security, as reduced genetic diversity, inconsistent crop yields, and decreased productivity in fisheries threaten resources. Changes in disease vectors and the emergence of novel pathogens and pests pose a direct threat to human health and resources. Understanding these impacts is crucial for adapting to and mitigating the influence of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.	6.2

Russia initially denied that any airstrikes had taken place, but satellite imagery and drone footage released by the Russian Ministry of Defence showed damage consistent with HRW's evidence. HRW has compiled video evidence and witness testimonies, and called on Russia to conduct a thorough investigation. This attack is one of many targeting civilian infrastructure in Syria, with over 4,200 schools damaged or destroyed during the six-year war. Efforts are being made to establish culpability for war crimes committed in Syria through the UN General Assembly and national courts in Europe and the United States.	6.2

It's sad that there are still outbreaks of cholera and other diseases that are easily preventable with sanitation and access to clean drinking water. If we all pitch in just a couple dollars, the cost of buying a bottle of water, I bet we could make a significant contribution to the relief effort in Yemen.	The number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen has risen to 1,410 within three weeks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The outbreak was declared on October 6, and by October 10, there were 24 suspected cases. However, as of Thursday, there were 1,410 suspected cases in 10 out of Yemen's 23 governorates. The conflict between a Saudi Arabia-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi group has destroyed much of Yemen's infrastructure, making it difficult to control the disease outbreak. Cholera is just one of the risks in Yemen's war, which has left millions displaced and in need of medical help. Only 47 of the suspected cases have tested positive for cholera, and the outbreak has spread beyond the capital to nine other governorates. Children under 10 account for half of the cases, with six deaths from cholera and 36 associated deaths from acute watery diarrhea. Prompt treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics is crucial in severe cases.	6.5

Lesin, a former aide of Russian President Vladimir Putin, died from head injuries sustained in accidental falls after excessive drinking, according to authorities in Washington. Lesin, who helped create the Kremlin's Russia Today television network, was found dead in a D.C. hotel room in November 2015. Initially ruled as ""undetermined,"" the manner of death has now been amended to an accident with acute ethanol intoxication as a contributing cause. Lesin's death was caused by blunt-force injuries to his head, as well as injuries to his neck, torso, arms, and legs from falls. The investigation determined that Lesin entered his hotel room for the final time after days of excessive alcohol consumption and was found dead the next morning. The ruling of accidental death has been accepted by the interim D.C. police chief. Lesin was known for his role in the Kremlin-dominated media landscape and his volatile temper. He resigned as head of Gazprom-Media in 2014 and kept a low profile until his death. Speculation about his death included theories of foul play due to his land dealings in California, but a friend and business associate believed he died after heavy drinking."	4.2

It's not fair, especially to the animals, since they don't really benefit from the coal mining.	India's unregulated coal industry has resulted in serious health and environmental issues. The mining has caused respiratory problems and illnesses like tuberculosis among people, while forests are being cleared for coal mining, leading to conflicts between wild elephants and humans. Elephants have caused significant property and crop damage, and deaths due to electrocution have become common. The affected communities have not received adequate compensation or support. Additionally, the generation of fly ash by power plants is causing pollution and leaching into groundwater. Lung diseases such as tuberculosis are prevalent in villages near open cast mines.	6.5

Consumer Reports has released a report identifying fifteen supplement ingredients that can cause illness or even death. The risks associated with these ingredients include cancer, organ damage, and cardiac arrest. The severity of the threats depends on factors such as pre-existing conditions, the quantity of ingredients taken, and the length of exposure. The report lists the dangerous ingredients, including aconite, caffeine powder, chaparral, coltsfoot, comfrey, germander, greater celandine, green tea extract powder, Kava, lobelia, methylsynephrine, pennyroyal oil, red yeast rice, usnic acid, and Yohimbe. The report warns against the use of these ingredients due to their potential health risks. The CDC has reported that the use of dietary supplements in the United States is common, with over forty percent of the population using them from 1998 to 2004.

"A new report by environmental group Amazon Watch reveals that the United States is driving the destruction of the Amazon rainforest by importing crude oil from the region. American refineries processed over 230,000 barrels of Amazon crude oil per day last year, with California alone refining an average of 170,978 barrels per day. The expansion of oil drilling in the Amazon poses a serious threat to the region, with proposed oil and gas fields covering an area larger than Texas. The destruction of the Amazon rainforest releases greenhouse gases and puts indigenous communities and biodiversity at risk. Ecuador's state oil company recently started drilling near the biologically rich Yasuni national park. Indigenous communities are at risk of pollution, displacement, and deadly illnesses. Amazon Watch is calling for a reduction in Amazon crude imports and the establishment of ""no go zones"" in decision making."	1.2

The text describes an undercover investigation into the exploitation of Syrian refugees and children in the garment industry in Turkey. The investigation reveals that many Syrian refugees, who lack work permits, are forced to work illegally in factories for low wages. The factories often hide workers during audits and continue exploiting them once the auditors leave. Some brands are aware of the abuses and are trying to address them, but others are unaware of the conditions in their supply chain. The investigation concludes that until brands have full visibility into their supply chain, the exploitation of refugees and children is likely to persist.	4.2

Doctors are overly calm about the things they prescribe to people, people that young shouldn't be subjected to that, and the death tolls aren't surprising.	A recent study has found that rates of toddlers and preschoolers being hospitalized for opioid overdoses have more than doubled in recent years. The study analyzed data from over 13,000 records of children admitted to U.S. hospitals between 1997 and 2012. The increase in overdoses is possibly due to the rise in prescribed painkillers, such as OxyContin and Vicodin. Young children are often exposed to these drugs by finding pills on the floor, getting into their parents' purses, or opening bottles. The study emphasizes the need for parents to limit children's exposure to these medications and for companies to improve packaging. The study also highlights the underreported issue of young overdoses in the pediatrics community. Additionally, the study found that heroin poisonings among children increased by 161%.	3.2

That’s the way another arbovirus, chikungunya works, he wrote in an article in Emerging Infectious Diseases last year. “The rate at which people are getting infected right now certainly suggests that we’re heading, within a year or two, to achieve sufficient herd immunity for this virus to die out,	The future of the Zika virus is uncertain. Experts have different opinions on how long it will stick around and how often it will return. Some believe it will behave like other arboviruses, recurring regularly with upticks in cases during the rainy season. Others predict that it will vanish in a few years, similar to chikungunya. The current outbreak in the Americas is due to the fact that people in the region had no immunity to the virus. Future outbreaks may be smaller if people develop immunity, but there could also be long lulls between outbreaks, allowing for a buildup of younger people who aren't immune. It is unclear if there will be fewer cases of microcephaly in the future due to the immunity gained from Zika infections. The impact of mosquito control efforts on young girls getting infected is also uncertain. It is unknown if Zika will strike Africa and Asia with the same ferocity as the Americas, but experts believe the two strains of Zika will be cross-protective. The uncertainty surrounding Zika's future affects the prospects for a vaccine. If Zika activity subsides, it will be difficult to conduct clinical trials to prove the vaccine's effectiveness. However, the fear of the virus's impact on developing fetuses may continue to drive demand for a vaccine.	4.2

The Forest Service has allowed heavy grazing and repeated violations on these public lands, despite acknowledging in 2003 that grazing was causing significant harm to resources. The lawsuit aims to protect the sensitive habitat for various fish species and improve management of the watershed. The grazing has also impacted recreational opportunities in the area. The groups are urging the Forest Service to take action and prioritize the preservation of these lands.	6.2

The crisis in Flint is unacceptable and to hear about the drinking fountain in Chicago makes things even worse. It makes you think that major improvements need to made across the US. New laws need to be put in place to ensure everyone is getting healthy water.	Chicago has shut down hundreds of public drinking fountains due to excessive levels of lead in the water. The ongoing crisis in Flint, Michigan has prompted other communities to test for lead, including the Chicago Park District. Testing revealed that nearly a quarter of outdoor fountains and 14 indoor fountains and sinks exceeded the federal standard for lead levels. Some fountains had lead levels 80 times higher than the permissible level. All fountains and sinks with high lead levels have been disabled and will undergo further testing and repairs. The lack of adequate testing for lead in public settings is a national problem, according to public health officials. Lead can have serious health effects, especially in young children, and there is no safe level of lead in the body. Lead pipes and fixtures are still common in communities across the country. While taking a sip from a single fountain may not seriously affect health, it can contribute to cumulative lead exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations like the homeless and children.	6.5

Residents in war-ravaged eastern Aleppo received a text message warning them to evacuate within 24 hours before a planned assault. The message, likely sent by the Syrian government, also gave rebels an ultimatum to surrender or be killed. While there were no reports of bombardment by Monday afternoon, witnesses spotted fighter jets in the city. Russian warplanes have been backing the regime with airstrikes since September, causing destruction in Aleppo. The UN warned that the city is on the brink of starvation and lacks essential supplies. Turkey has been carrying out airstrikes in northern Syria to support the Free Syrian Army and plans to move on to Manbij after liberating al-Bab from ISIS. This move has stirred sectarian tensions and complicated efforts to free Syrian cities from ISIS control. Turkey considers some Kurdish militia groups as terrorists, while the US supports and arms them. The conflict between the US and Russia over which groups to target in Syria further complicates the situation.	6.5

A mass grave containing the bodies of hundreds of Iraqi policemen who were executed by ISIS has been discovered near Mosul. The grave was found by Iraqi security forces during their assault on the ISIS stronghold. The bodies are believed to have been buried as recently as October, just before the US-backed forces began their assault on Mosul. The grave was visited by Human Rights Watch, who found four exposed corpses and piles of rubbish covering other bodies. Witnesses reported that ISIS rounded up around 2,000 people from the area and forced them to head towards Mosul, separating the former policemen and driving them away. Gunfire and screams were heard on multiple occasions, indicating further executions. Human Rights Watch has called for ISIS to be held accountable for these crimes against humanity.	4.2

Trump's handling of Mexico has been atrocious. While illegal immigration may have fallen, it's no reason to treat such a big trading partner like a second class world citizen by telling them they have to pay for a wall. A wall which would be completely useless as far as keeping people out, because there are such things as shovels and boats. It's just completely absurd.	Mexico is bracing for the consequences of a Trump presidency, as his campaign promises of building a wall, renegotiating trade deals, and deporting Mexican immigrants threaten the country's economy and relationship with the US. The peso has already suffered a significant drop, and experts predict a turbulent financial future for Mexico. The election has also caused an existential crisis for Mexico, as it reflects the negative image the country has in the US. Canada is also concerned about the impact of Trump's presidency, particularly on trade. While some Canadians reacted with anxiety, others saw it as an opportunity for pride. The election has forced Mexico to rethink its relationship with the US, and President Peña Nieto has expressed his willingness to work with Trump. However, paying for a wall is out of Mexico's vision, and the country hopes to continue collaborating with the US for mutual development. The election will likely have the most profound impact on the economy, as the US and Mexico are deeply integrated in terms of trade and employment. Mexico is America's third-largest trading partner, and millions of American jobs are tied to trade with Mexico. Trump's argument that Mexico benefits more from NAFTA than the US resonated with some voters, but experts believe that Mexico has little leverage to apply pressure in the relationship. An economic crisis in Mexico could lead to a migration crisis, as Mexicans may seek work in the US. However, some believe that the threat from the outside will bring Mexicans together and encourage them to work harder. There is optimism that Trump's hostile talk will diminish once he takes office, and that economic factors will temper his policies towards Mexico. However, with the Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump's victory signals an ideological realignment in the US.	4.2

It turns out that low level employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need. Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money. Then its the workers getting fired.	Wells Fargo Bank has admitted to firing 5,300 low-paid workers over five years for opening fake accounts to meet sales targets. The bank has faced outrage and has stalled stock awards to two top executives. Wells Fargo CEO/Chairman John Stumpf admitted to finding nearly 80,000 phony accounts in Pennsylvania. The bank claims that it did not impose fees for most of these accounts. However, former employees have reported unethical practices, such as raiding customers' private data and forging credit card application signatures.

"Multiple studies show that Trump's sexist rhetoric can have a significant impact on thinking, stress, and self-esteem. Women have expressed feeling gross and objectified by his comments, and even trauma victims have been distressed by his behavior. Trump's defense that his words are ""just words"" or ""locker room talk"" does not render them harmless, as rude language can impair cognition and lead to less creative thinking. Uncivil political discourse, especially in a presidential debate, undermines trust in government and discourages women from running for office. Discriminatory speech has negative consequences for women, leading to anger, depression, and lower self-esteem. Different types of discrimination can compound each other, with women of color experiencing even greater harm. Trump's candidacy exposes the bleak state of gender relations in the US and raises questions about how sexism will be taken seriously in the future."	6.5

The chemistry going on in our body is somthing I cant even get ahold of. The pill though is such a thing we need if we dont want to have babies that this time. The after math of it is just a deeper conversation we have to understand so that we dont end of hurting ourself.	A study from the University of Copenhagen has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study, which tracked one million Danish women for 13 years, found that women taking the combined oral contraceptive were 23% more likely to be diagnosed with depression, while those using progestin-only pills were 34% more likely. Teens were at the greatest risk, with an 80% increase in depression when taking the combined pill. Other hormone-based methods, such as the hormonal IUS/coil, the patch, and the ring, were shown to increase depression at a higher rate than oral contraceptives. The study suggests that the practice of encouraging teens to use these alternatives to the pill is misguided. The medical community's response to the study has been dismissive, with experts downplaying the link and offering paternalistic advice. The burden of avoiding unwanted pregnancy falls on women, despite the potential negative effects on their health and wellbeing. Effective alternatives to hormonal contraceptives exist, but they are often overlooked. It is important to remember that women are twice as likely to experience depression as men, and blaming women's depression on their biological femaleness is acceptable, but blaming medication formulated from synthetic hormones is not. The study's authors plan to research the possible association between hormonal birth control and suicide attempts or completions. While not every woman experiences depression and anxiety from hormonal contraceptives, it is important to acknowledge that many do, and their lives could be improved by recognizing and addressing this issue.	4.2

Withdrawing from the Paris treaty supposedly will contribute to global warming, along with doing away with the clean air act Obama passed while in office.  There's so much involved with climate change its hard to tell what is fact.  States are taking measures into their own hands to the extent they can I guess.	President-Elect Donald J. Trump's policies could have catastrophic effects on the planet's climate. By withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and terminating President Obama's Clean Power Plan, Trump could push global temperatures to rise higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius, leading to devastating consequences such as extreme weather patterns and mass extinctions. While other countries are committed to their climate commitments, Trump's actions could encourage them to abandon their commitments and emit more greenhouse gases. Trump's denial of climate change and his intention to cut off American support for UN climate science further exacerbate the situation. However, climate activists and environmental leaders are determined to continue their efforts at the local and state levels, pushing for emissions-restriction plans and the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure. Despite the divisions between Democrats and Republicans on climate policy, there is bipartisan support for investments in clean energy and climate resilience. The construction of wind and solar power plants could not only address climate change but also boost U.S. manufacturing and reduce electricity costs.

The US's hunt for crude oil is coming with disastrous consequences and needs to be rectified. By tearing down the Amazon trees, hurtful greenhouse gases are rising into the air, damaging the air quality around us. Corporations shouldn't be able to hurt the environment like this. It makes me angry.	"A new report by environmental group Amazon Watch reveals that the United States is driving the destruction of the Amazon rainforest by importing crude oil from the region. American refineries processed over 230,000 barrels of Amazon crude oil per day last year, with California alone refining an average of 170,978 barrels per day. The expansion of oil drilling in the Amazon poses a serious threat to the region, with proposed oil and gas fields covering an area larger than Texas. The destruction of the Amazon rainforest releases greenhouse gases and puts indigenous communities and biodiversity at risk. Ecuador's state oil company recently started drilling near the biologically rich Yasuni national park. Indigenous communities are at risk of pollution, displacement, and deadly illnesses. Amazon Watch is calling for a reduction in Amazon crude imports and the establishment of ""no go zones"" in decision making."	6.2

I also hate his only tactic for arguing against his opponent, drawing on his personal life.  Instead of highlighting his policies, he’s trying to win on popularity.  I would never, ever vote for this guy!	Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, is facing a tough re-election fight after years of comfortable victories. His decision to embrace Donald Trump has worsened his chances of winning. His opponent, Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel, has received significant financial support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Issa has tried to fight back by highlighting accusations made against Applegate by his former wife. In another California district, Representative Jeff Denham is also facing a tough re-election fight. Denham, like Issa, has expressed support for Trump. Both districts have a large and growing Latino population, which is expected to vote against Trump. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC have invested over $4 million to defeat Issa and Denham. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, has given over $1.6 million to Denham. Denham's refusal to disavow Trump has put him at odds with the editorial board of The Modesto Bee, the largest newspaper in his district, which has endorsed his opponent, Michael Eggman.	1.2

It is even more sad knowing that people got injured. Some things just aren't fair in life and you never see it coming.	Two earthquakes hit central Italy, causing further damage to buildings already weakened by the August quake. Although there were no reports of serious injuries or deaths, the aftershocks revealed structural weaknesses in the area and added to the psychological stress of the residents. The government has allocated 40 million euros for housing those displaced by the quakes and promised to begin reconstruction soon. Thousands of people slept in their cars as emergency shelter was inadequate. The towns of Ussita and Visso were particularly affected, with a large percentage of houses deemed uninhabitable. The historic bell tower in Camerino collapsed, but the mayor stated that previous reconstruction work had contributed to the absence of serious injuries. With winter approaching, officials are considering alternative solutions to tents for housing the affected population, particularly the elderly.	6.2

The suspect behind the mall attack in Minnesota has been identified as 22-year-old Dahir Aden, a Somali-American student. He stabbed nine people at a shopping mall before being shot and killed by an off-duty police officer. Aden's family first learned of his death from the police, and authorities have not formally identified him as a suspect. Aden's father described him as an honors student with no history of violence. The Somali community expressed fears of backlash and called for unity. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities are still investigating any potential links to foreign terrorist organizations.

Dahir Ahmed Adan, a 20-year-old Somali refugee, was identified as the suspect in the stabbing spree at a Minnesota mall. He allegedly stabbed 10 people before being shot dead by an off-duty police officer. Adan was wearing a private security uniform and asked at least one person if they were Muslim while carrying out the stabbings. Although an ISIS-affiliated media outlet claimed responsibility, there is no evidence linking Adan to the terrorist group. Adan was described as a quiet and studious young man from a well-known local Somali family. He had recently called his soccer coach for weight-loss advice and was out of work after his part-time security guard job ended. Investigators are examining Adan's media accounts and electronic devices to determine his motive. Minnesota has the largest Somali community in the US, and community leaders expressed concern about potential backlash. The Somali community in Minnesota has been targeted by ISIS for recruitment, with several individuals convicted or charged with supporting the extremist group.	3.2

Bishop Marchel, a leader in the Moldovan Orthodox Church, also attacked Sandu, claiming that her attitude towards Christian morality diverges from normal principles. Sandu defended herself, stating that being a single woman is not a shame. Voronin also criticized Sandu's opponent, Igor Dodon, but implied that Dodon is a preferable choice. Sandu has campaigned on a pro-European Union platform, while Dodon aligns his views with those of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

He discussed his plans for FBI Director James Comey, saying he hasn't made up his mind about whether to ask for his resignation. Trump also addressed his stance on same-sex marriage, abortion, and deporting undocumented immigrants. He pledged to focus on deporting criminals and building a border wall. Trump defended his transition team, which includes lobbyists, saying that they know the system but will be phased out. He stuck by his claim that he knows more than American generals about fighting ISIS. Trump also expressed support for ditching the Electoral College and handing the presidency to the winner of the popular vote.

Yet they all continued because .... why? I know the whole thing about the military is going along and just obeying orders but what was going on there was seriously seriously messed up.	The mental health care provided to detainees at Guantánamo Bay has been compromised by a lack of training, ethical boundaries, and information about their treatment during interrogations. Psychiatrists and psychologists were often unaware of the abuse that had taken place, and were discouraged from asking detainees about their experiences. The quality of care has been criticized by human rights groups and defense teams, who argue that it has been negligent and ineffective. Many detainees suffer from psychological problems as a result of their treatment, but PTSD is rarely diagnosed due to the impracticality of treatment in the prison environment. The mental health personnel faced numerous challenges, including distrust from detainees and the blurred lines between medical care and interrogation. Despite these obstacles, they did their best to provide care to the prisoners.	6.2

Coconut trees are facing threats from lethal yellowing bacteria in the Caribbean, Cote d'Ivoire, and Papua New Guinea, which could lead to a shortage of coconuts. Unlike other crops, coconuts cannot be stored in seed vaults due to their high water content, so maintaining living gene banks is necessary. However, these gene banks require a lot of space and are vulnerable to land grabs. Additionally, growing and breeding coconuts is challenging due to their long maturation period and the need for hand pollination. Efforts to isolate and freeze coconut embryos for preservation are still unreliable. Funding for coconut gene banks is also limited, as most coconut growers are small farmers. The future of the Coconut Genetic Resources Network (COGENT) is uncertain due to funding issues.	4.2

Infants, middle schoolers, high schoolers… It is not easy for kids to be kids, to depend on parents who are also struggle with their problems and issues. The issues of communication, balancing, keeping priorities are especially importance in the relationships with your middle school children: it is critical time to form your lifelong relationship with them and, probably, it is one of the most challenging period.	A new study by Arizona State University researchers found that middle school is the most stressful time for mothers. The study involved analyzing surveys from over 2,200 well-educated moms across the country, and mothers of only middle-school-age children reported the highest levels of stress, loneliness, and emptiness. Middle school is a challenging time for children, with raging hormones, changing bodies and brains, exposure to peer pressure and risky behaviors, and a desire for independence while still feeling dependent on parents. Parents often struggle to navigate these changes and may not realize that their children still want a relationship with them. It is important for parents to listen, be supportive, and not give up during this time. Developing a strong relationship during middle school can carry into the teen years and young adulthood. Mothers should also reach out to other moms for support during this challenging time.	6.2

The husband alleges that they were subjected to homophobic taunts and slurs from crewmembers before the incident. The argument escalated, and the husband fell off the stateroom balcony, landing on a lifeboat before falling into the ocean. The complaint states that security officers failed to secure and rescue him. The Coast Guard performed a search-and-rescue operation, but the body was never found. The husband is seeking compensatory damages for negligence and emotional distress.	6.2

He tortured them repeatedly inside of his luxurious downtown apartment near Hong Kong's red light district. He planned to torture them with tools and sex toys but had to cut it short when one of the women started screaming loudly in his apartment. He slit her throat and stuffed her body into a suitcase.	"A British banker, Rurik Jutting, has been found guilty of murdering two Indonesian women in Hong Kong. The jury returned unanimous verdicts after a two-week trial, highlighting the significant inequality in Hong Kong and the decadent lifestyles of some expatriates. Jutting, who was sentenced to life in prison, has the right to appeal but has indicated that he will request a transfer to a British prison. The judge described the case as one of the most horrifying murder cases in Hong Kong and called Jutting an ""archetypal sexual predator."" The families of the victims welcomed the verdict but expressed that the sentence does not compare to the pain they have endured."	1.0

Meanwhile, across the US, trees are dying at an alarming rate due to climate change, drought, disease, insects, and wildfires. California has lost 66 million trees since 2010, primarily due to drought and pine beetles. The spread of ""Sudden Oak Death"" is also infecting various plants in northern California. The presence of dead trees poses a significant fire hazard. Furthermore, a study has found that household dust exposes people to toxic chemicals, with phthalates being the most commonly found.

I gotta think this is just another example of pure evil, killing kids all the while the government takes aid, money, food, or whatever and keeps it for themselves or sells it to the people and puts them in servitude. God bless the USA!	Despite significant progress in global vaccination efforts, measles still claims the lives of more than 350 children daily, according to a report by UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and other health agencies. The report emphasizes that the fight against measles is hindered not by a lack of tools or knowledge, but by a lack of political will to ensure every child is immunized. While vaccination campaigns and increased routine vaccine coverage have saved millions of lives, there are still countries where a majority of children are not vaccinated. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan account for half of all unvaccinated babies and 75% of measles-related deaths. Outbreaks of measles in various countries, caused by gaps in immunization, remain a significant problem. The report highlights the need to immunize young people who have missed out on vaccinations and notes that measles tends to resurge during conflicts or humanitarian crises.	3.2

Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans took to the streets in Seoul for the second consecutive weekend, demanding the resignation of President Park Geun-hye. The protests were sparked by Park's admission that she shared classified information with someone lacking security clearance. The demonstrations, which included families, students, and union members, were some of the largest anti-government protests in decades. Four officers and 26 protesters were injured during the protests. Park's spokesman stated that she realizes the seriousness of the situation and is considering ways to normalize affairs. Protesters are calling for Park's resignation due to feelings of betrayal and frustration with her leadership. The protests also stem from other incidents, such as the Sewol ferry sinking. Despite roadblocks, protesters attempted to march to the presidential palace. The demonstrations will continue until there are answers and a resolution to the political turmoil.	6.2

The article claims that Russia's most popular social network, VKontakte (VK), has numerous groups that encourage vulnerable young people to kill themselves. The article alleges that at least 80 recent suicides can be linked to these online groups. Critics have accused the article of sensationalism and placing too much emphasis on the internet as a cause of juvenile suicide.

"A study has found that projected climate change by 2070 will occur too quickly for grass species, including wheat, corn, rice, and sorghum, to adapt. This poses a risk to the world's ability to grow enough food, as these species provide almost half of the calories consumed by humans. The grass family is not only important for diets but also for global biodiversity and ecosystems. The study compared the rates of climate change niche change in grass species with projected climate change and found a significant difference. This suggests that many grass species may disappear from certain locations. While the study did not focus on food security, it highlights the potential problems for farmers growing food crops. However, there is ongoing research to develop ""climate-proof"" food crops using wild relatives of domesticated species. Unfortunately, these wild relatives are also at risk from climate change."	6.5

It is bad for the government of Louisiana, but you can't blame these people for getting out. And, of course, there is nothing that they can do to stop them.	The flood-ravaged state of Louisiana may face a population loss as residents consider leaving after the flood waters recede. While few people have confirmed their departure, it is a topic of discussion among many. The state's economy will suffer if there is a decline in population, as it will reduce spending and tax revenue. Louisiana experienced a 6% population decrease after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, taking over five years to recover. Although this year's exodus is unlikely to be as severe, the shortage of available housing and the closure of small businesses due to the flooding pose challenges. Additionally, the decline in oil industry jobs and the state's high unemployment rate further complicate the situation. The aid and insurance money that typically accompanies natural disasters may not be enough to prevent people from leaving, exacerbating an already struggling economy.	4.2

A palm oil company named PT Mohairson Pawan Khatulistiwa plans to clear more than half of the Sungai Putri forest in Indonesia, which is home to a critically endangered orangutan population. Despite the Indonesian government's commitment to protecting peat, forests, and orangutans, the company has been granted a license to destroy the forest. The forest is at risk of being converted into an industrial tree plantation, and the company has already started work on building a drainage canal. The destruction of the forest and the orangutans' habitat is incompatible with Indonesia's national action plan for orangutans. The development violates Indonesia's legal processes and international commitments. Improved management is needed in Sungai Putri to address illegal logging and fires. There are conflicting opinions on the deforestation, with some supporting it for potential employment opportunities and compensation, while others argue that it is unsustainable. Alternative solutions that involve collaboration between various stakeholders are available to fulfill development objectives and alleviate poverty in Indonesia.	3.2

The number of firearm murders increased by roughly 1,500, while knife murders dropped slightly. The percentage of murders committed with guns increased to 71.5%. Despite the increase in murders, overall crime rates did not increase substantially. The attorney general mentioned the overall increase in violent crime but did not mention the increase in murders. A third of the murder increase was driven by ten larger cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Black men and women face less violence today than in the early 1990s. In a separate incident, two New Jersey Transit buses crashed in the Lincoln Tunnel, injuring as many as 44 people.	6.2

All of these people just happen to be overnight workers, too. The fact that the lack of sleep and quality sleep can lead to a higher risk of stroke is very alarming. So many people need to seek help for sleep disorders, because where the disorder itself may not cause major health issues, it can lead to major health issues.	A new review suggests that sleep disorders increase the risk of stroke and affect recovery. The study found a link between sleep breathing problems and stroke risk and recovery, but less evidence for the link between sleep-wake disorders and stroke. People with sleep disorders may be more likely to have another stroke or other health problems. For those with sleep apnea, treatment with a continuous positive airway pressure machine (CPAP) is recommended.

A new review suggests that sleep disorders increase the risk of stroke and affect recovery. The study found a link between sleep breathing problems and stroke risk and recovery, but less evidence for the link between sleep-wake disorders and stroke. People with sleep disorders may be more likely to have another stroke or other health problems. For those with sleep apnea, treatment with a continuous positive airway pressure machine (CPAP) is recommended.

A woman appeared on The Dr Phil Show to share her horrifying experience of being sexually abused by both of her parents. The victim, Amanda, revealed that her parents forced her to have sex with them and even made her pose for explicit photographs and videos to sell online. Her mother, Justine, expressed remorse for her actions and admitted to making poor choices. Both parents were charged with sexual assault and exploitation and received 20-year prison sentences. Amanda also claimed that her mother coached her sexually and was a willing participant in the abuse. Despite the trauma, Amanda's parents would continue with normal family life after the abuse. Amanda has struggled to come to terms with the fact that her parents are now out of prison. Her father, Jim, has yet to apologize to her and has been described as manipulative. Justine blamed their behavior on money, stating that Jim discovered the profitability of child pornography.

This article highlights the fact that although we may have profound faith in the goodness of human nature, we never know when a killer is walking among us. The recent spate of mass shootings at schools and other locations underline the presence of disturbed people in our midst. Besides defending ourselves, we need to ask ourselves what in our society is provoking this disturbing behavior. Certainly the ubiquity and ease of acquiring guns is one cause, but there may be others that need attention as well.	A suspected serial killer in Anchorage, Alaska was stopped by a police officer who was responding to a theft complaint. The officer, Arn Salao, was shot multiple times by the suspect, James Dale Ritchie, but managed to return fire and fight off his assailant. Another officer arrived at the scene and also fired at Ritchie, killing him. Ballistics tests revealed that the gun Ritchie used was the same one used in five other homicides in Anchorage in 2016. Ritchie had prior arrests for drugs and burglary and had recently returned to Alaska from West Virginia. Two of the victims linked to Ritchie's gun were identified as Jason Netter Sr. and Brianna Foisy, who were found dead in July. Another two victims, Bryant De Husson and Kevin Schuyler Turner, were found dead in August. The motive behind the killings is unknown, and it is unclear if Ritchie knew any of the victims. The police believe that the chance encounter between Officer Salao and Ritchie may have saved countless lives. Two other unsolved double homicides in Anchorage have not been linked to Ritchie.	6.2

"PTSD is a misunderstood and stigmatized disorder that affects many veterans. It is estimated that 8 million Americans suffer from PTSD, with rates among Vietnam War and Iraq War veterans being particularly high. The negative connotations surrounding PTSD prevent many veterans from seeking help. Veterans want others to know that referring to them as ""weak"" is ignorant, as war experiences are incomprehensible to those who haven't lived through them. PTSD symptoms can be masked and go unnoticed, making it difficult to recognize. Many PTSD sufferers suffer in silence, fearing judgment and trying to appear strong. Contrary to popular belief, PTSD does not make individuals violent. Recovery from PTSD is possible, and veterans encourage others to seek help and know that they are not alone."	4.2

I am really disappointed.  It may not be a majority of children who are at-risk or afflicted, but for the few children who are , this information would have been everything.	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a viral infection that poses a greater threat to infants in the United States than Zika, but it is rarely discussed. CMV can cause permanent disabilities such as hearing loss, microcephaly, intellectual deficits, and vision abnormalities in up to 20% of infected infants. There is no vaccine or standard treatment for CMV, but there are hints that antiviral drugs may benefit some newborns. CMV is transmitted through contact with saliva and urine, often from diaper-wearing children to adults. Pregnant women often get it from toddlers, especially those in day care. However, few women are warned about this infection, and less than half of obstetrician-gynecologists provide information on how to avoid CMV. Some experts argue that education campaigns and infant screening for the infection should be carried out to prevent the devastating effects of CMV. Routine screening of newborns for CMV is being pushed to identify those who are infected early and provide them with necessary tests and treatment. A recent study found that infants with CMV symptoms at birth who took an antiviral drug for six months had better hearing and cognitive skills at 2 years. However, it is not yet known if antiviral medication is safe and effective for babies with only hearing loss as a symptom. CMV infection can have long-term effects on a child's development, and the full extent of these effects may not be known until the child is in school.	6.5

The one where the idiots decided to use their own water supply from a dam which leaked led. Well apparently now the government is flipping out that its a nationwide problem. Or should I say the ""scientists"" are flipping out since we have never heard of lead in the water anywhere outside of the Flint MI disaster"	A new report by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) reveals that over 18 million Americans are supplied with drinking water that violates federal laws on lead content. The report states that the water crisis in Flint, Michigan is not an isolated incident, and that violations of national rules protecting against lead contamination are widespread. The NRDC's analysis of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows that 5,363 water systems, serving more than 18 million people, breached the federal Lead and Copper Rule in 2015. These violations include inadequate testing for lead and insufficient treatment to prevent lead from leaching into the water supply. The violations occurred in almost every state, with 1,110 community water utilities providing water that exceeded the EPA's actionable limit for lead. Despite the widespread failure of water suppliers, very few were punished by the EPA last year. Of the over 8,000 violations, enforcement action was only taken against 11% of cases, and penalties were sought for just 3% of violations. The EPA has acknowledged the challenges in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule and has intensified work with state drinking water programs. However, a revised rule will not be implemented until 2017 at the earliest. The NRDC emphasizes that unsafe drinking water is a national problem that requires a national solution. The failure of the system to detect violations is highlighted by the fact that Flint was not considered in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule last year, despite the well-known water crisis. The CDC has reported that lead levels in the blood of Flint children significantly increased after the city switched its water supply. The NRDC also revealed that water utilities often manipulate test results to downplay lead levels. The Guardian has reported that at least 33 US cities have used methods to mask the true level of lead in water tests. The report raises concerns about the extent of the issue and calls for a coordinated effort at all levels to prevent future crises.	1.2

"Multiple studies show that Trump's sexist rhetoric can have a significant impact on thinking, stress, and self-esteem. Women have expressed feeling gross and objectified by his comments, and even trauma victims have been distressed by his behavior. Trump's defense that his words are ""just words"" or ""locker room talk"" does not render them harmless, as rude language can impair cognition and lead to less creative thinking. Uncivil political discourse, especially in a presidential debate, undermines trust in government and discourages women from running for office. Discriminatory speech has negative consequences for women, leading to anger, depression, and lower self-esteem. Different types of discrimination can compound each other, with women of color experiencing even greater harm.

Hey just wanted to share this article with you and let you know some thoughts/feelings about it. I know that we have talked before about the importance of vaccinations, and if it is safe for kids to get them. I think this story really made me think about that and brought fourth some really interesting facts and data that make you see how it is changing and hurting different parts of the world. I feel that kids should receive these vaccinations as they are a easy way to help and protect people all over the world rather than taking a risk.	Despite significant progress in global vaccination efforts, measles still claims the lives of more than 350 children daily, according to a report by UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and other health agencies. The report emphasizes that the fight against measles is hindered not by a lack of tools or knowledge, but by a lack of political will to ensure every child is immunized. While vaccination campaigns and increased routine vaccine coverage have saved millions of lives, there are still countries where a majority of children are not vaccinated. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan account for half of all unvaccinated babies and 75% of measles-related deaths. Outbreaks of measles in various countries, caused by gaps in immunization, remain a significant problem. The report highlights the need to immunize young people who have missed out on vaccinations and notes that measles tends to resurge during conflicts or humanitarian crises.	6.2

The person who gets the short end of the stick in this case will probably be the child who will be forced to split time and maybe even countries between the two parents.

I am sad about the loss of lives. I am in disbelief. How could this happen? The article said they do not believe it was a terrosit attack so that makes me feel relieved, but still worried. US is there to assist Jordan for training. Why our are people being attacked?! The article said they failed to stop at the entrance so I do not know if maybe it was a miscommunication. I am confused to what actually happened. From what I read there was an attack on Jordan when they just drove and barralled through their border so they are on high alert. My heart goes out to all of those involved and I am sad. But why on earth would they think that the US military personal are planning	Three U.S. military trainers were killed in Jordan when their vehicle failed to stop at the gate of a military base and security forces opened fire. The incident occurred at the King Faisal Air Base, and the cause is currently under investigation. Jordan is a close ally of the United States and is part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria. The U.S. Embassy in Amman stated that they are in contact with Jordanian authorities and do not believe the incident was terrorism-related. The King Faisal base is used for joint exercises and training Western-backed Syrian rebels. There are over 1,000 U.S. military personnel based in Jordan, primarily serving as advisers. Jordan's military has been on high alert since a deadly attack in June 2016.	6.2

Teachers at his school had expressed concerns about his well-being, but social workers found no cause for alarm. The boy's stepfather believed he was living in Mexico until the mother revealed that he had died. The boy's body was found in a closet, severely malnourished and covered in pressure sores. The mother has been charged with murder and child abuse. The family lived in a one-bedroom house, with the boy kept hidden in closets and sedated with sleep medications. The other children in the family were aware of the situation but concealed it from their stepfather. The stepfather was devastated upon learning the truth and called the police. A public memorial was held for the boy, and the stepfather vowed to continue telling his story to prevent similar cases from happening again.	4.2

If true, these shipwrecks bring the toll of dead and missing in the Mediterranean to 4,220 this year, the highest on record. Most of the migrants appear to have come from sub-Saharan Africa. The European Union is conducting a search-and-rescue operation in the western Mediterranean, but the focus remains on deterrence rather than protection. The shifting migration patterns have been a boon to smugglers, as demand has increased across the trickier North African route.	6.5

In Iraq, Islamic State militants are kidnapping thousands of people at gunpoint to use as shields against the U.S. takeover as the militants move to their last stronghold of Mosul.   This is something that complicates the U.S. airstrikes because it is not certain how many civilians might be injured or killed since they are being used as shields by the militants.   As the militants are squeezed tighter and tighter together in their last stronghold, more and more villages are suffering, entire villages of people are being taken and used as these shields.   It is a terrible situation and I cannot imagine the suffering as people are missing and lost forever from families and leaving many children as orphans.	Islamic State militants in Iraq are kidnapping thousands of villagers and using them as human shields as they retreat towards Mosul. Those who refuse to comply are shot, while others are taken but manage to escape. The militants are also executing former policemen and army officers out of paranoia. This tactic of holding civilians hostage complicates the U.S.-led airstrikes and puts civilians at risk of being caught in crossfire. The militants have also set fire to oil wells and a sulfur plant, causing noxious fumes. As Iraqi forces advance towards Mosul, the militants are expected to put up a tough fight.	6.5

The United Nations has expressed concern over the sharp increase in civilian casualties in Yemen since peace talks collapsed last month. The majority of these casualties were caused by airstrikes from a coalition led by Saudi Arabia. At least 329 civilians have been killed and 426 injured since the beginning of August. Saudi Arabia and its allies are trying to prevent an international investigation into possible war crimes. The United States and Britain, major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia, are finding it harder to ignore the bloodshed. The most recent example of the carnage was an airstrike on a market and residential area in Hodeidah, which killed at least 26 civilians. The United Nations has documented numerous attacks on civilian facilities by both coalition and rebel forces. Doctors Without Borders has pulled staff members out of six hospitals in Yemen after coalition planes bombed a facility. The United Nations has also expressed concern over the blockade of the city of Taiz, which has left residents critically short of food and water. The majority of civilian casualties have been caused by the Saudi-led coalition, according to a report to the Human Rights Council. Saudi Arabia and President Hadi's government have condemned the report as biased and have proposed a Yemeni commission to investigate human rights violations. Rights groups argue that a national body lacks expertise and that its reporting falls short of international standards. The European Union has drafted a competing resolution calling for a United Nations mission to Yemen. The Council will decide how to proceed after a week of diplomatic negotiations. President Hadi accused Iran of blocking the path towards peace in Yemen.	4.9

Millions of trees across the United States are dying due to a combination of factors including disease, insects, drought, and wildfires, all exacerbated by climate change. One example is the rapid ohi'a death disease in Hawaii, which has infected nearly 50,000 acres of native forest. The cause of this disease is still unknown, and scientists are struggling to find a treatment. In California, an invasive pathogen called Sudden Oak Death is killing millions of trees, including redwoods. Bark beetles and mountain pine beetles are also wreaking havoc on forests, expanding their range due to climate change. The loss of trees has far-reaching consequences, affecting clean water, carbon storage, and entire ecosystems. Scientists are working on genetic research to understand why some trees are able to survive these threats, but they warn that in a few decades, American forests may be unrecognizable.	3.2

Someone very close to me deals with tinnitus every day, and I always thought it was odd because I'm the one who has worked in high noise environments, but she's the one who suffers with it. It's interesting because it says psychotherapy is a possible solution which would make us very happy if it's real.	A study published in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery reveals that one in ten Americans suffer from tinnitus, a persistent buzzing or ringing in the ears. The study found that tinnitus is connected to hearing loss and is often not discussed with doctors. The research also shows that higher rates of tinnitus are reported in individuals with consistent exposure to loud noises, either at work or during recreational activities. Treatment options include hearing aids and psychotherapy to change the way affected individuals think about tinnitus.	6.2

"The residents of Matheny Tract, a poor community in California's Central Valley, have been living with contaminated water for years. They have had to pay for bottled water in addition to their tainted tap water. However, legislation based on the ""human right to water"" is now being implemented, and Matheny Tract will be the first community to receive clean water under this law. Similar legislation has been introduced in Michigan, but is still stuck in committee. The issue of water inequality in rural communities has been brought to the forefront by the state's record-breaking drought. Many small rural systems in California have contaminated water, affecting an estimated 160,000 people. These communities often lack public investment and are overlooked by their local governments. The right to water is seen as a fundamental human right, and California's legislation is seen as a step towards addressing water inequality. The state has also introduced a publicly accessible database on water systems that are out of compliance. Matheny Tract is scheduled to receive clean water on June 1, marking a significant improvement for the community."	1.2

Humans are causing it. It will soon be a major problem for us all. It affects all life on earth, not just people. Biodiversity has been affected and has gone down. Temperatures are changing for the worse. It's simply awful.	Climate change has had a broad impact on ecosystems, with evidence of its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. A study identified 94 core ecological processes, of which 82% showed evidence of impact from climate change. These impacts range from shifts in species ranges and changes in phenology to disruptions at the genetic and ecosystem levels. Species are adapting to temperature extremes, with changes in physiology and morphology. Changes in phenology, abundance, and distribution of species have also been observed. These impacts have implications for food security, as reduced genetic diversity, inconsistent crop yields, and decreased productivity in fisheries threaten resources. Changes in disease vectors and the emergence of novel pathogens and pests pose a direct threat to human health and resources. Understanding these impacts is crucial for adapting to and mitigating the influence of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.	6.5

I can believe that it happens with teenagers, but it's starting to become more common in children and preteens too.  I can't imagine the anguish you would feel to lose a young child to suicide.  I can't imagine how you would move on from that.	According to new government data, the rate of suicide deaths among children aged 10 to 14 has doubled since 2007. However, deaths from motor vehicle traffic and homicide have decreased over the same time period. Younger children may attempt suicide impulsively due to bad relationships with family and friends, while older children may do so because of relationship issues. Warning signs for suicide in children include increased sadness, irritability, anger, loss of interest in friends or activities, and saying mean or derogatory things. It is important for parents to talk to their children and listen to their feelings. There is limited research on suicide in children, and experts hope that the report will raise awareness and lead to more prevention efforts.	6.9

It is such a sad story, and until we get the guns off the street, these stories are just going to keep coming up.	A retired D.C. police officer shot and killed his son during a domestic dispute in their home. The son, Carl Holloway, had a weapon, but the type was not disclosed. No charges have been filed, and the father's identity has not been released. The shooting took place in Northeast Washington, and investigators are determining if it was justified. Holloway had a prior assault charge and was scheduled to appear in court.

There are some countries that are for the poaching of elephants if you can believe it. Some more rural communities say that the animals harm their crops. I've never heard this side of the argument before! I'm not saying I agree with it, but we're over here in America and have a way different perspective on the issues. It's interesting to see how different things are over there.	At a global wildlife summit, a bid to provide the highest level of international legal protection to all African elephants was defeated. However, new measures were passed to add vital protection for elephants, including the closure of legal ivory markets within nations and tougher measures to deal with nations failing to control poached ivory. The debate over elephant poaching has divided African countries, with some arguing that making money from ivory sales and trophy hunting is necessary for protection, while others believe that poaching and the illegal ivory trade pose the greatest threat. Most African elephants already have the highest level of international legal protection, but elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Botswana have a lower level of protection. A proposal to upgrade these populations to the highest level of protection was defeated. The EU and some scientific and conservation groups opposed the upgrade, arguing that it did not meet the biological criteria. The issue of cutting the demand for ivory and better enforcement against poachers were highlighted as key solutions.	4.2

Someone thought it was new worthy to make the world aware that he and his wife got into a screaming match and she was afraid.  The truth is, no one but their family knows what's really going on.  His wife could be a very dramatic person.  She could be giving him a hard time.  While domestic violence and emotional abuse should never be tolerated, we should leave people to deal with their own screaming matches.	Scottie Pippen's wife, Larsa Pippen, told police that she was scared of him during an argument at their home. The NBA star broke his own cell phone out of frustration during the altercation. This incident occurred shortly before Scottie filed for divorce. Larsa informed the police that they were having marital problems and that Scottie would raise his voice, yell, and scare her. The police report states that Scottie admitted to the argument and breaking his phone in frustration. Larsa mentioned that she would be speaking to an attorney. No arrests were made, and there were no allegations of domestic violence. Scottie's unhappiness with Larsa's relationship with Future had been a point of contention between them.	3.2

Demirtaş has made it a personal crusade to oppose Erdoğan’s plan for a presidential system in Turkey, which the HDP says would lead to dictatorship.	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has escalated his conflict with the Kurdish opposition by arresting at least eight members of parliament from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), including the party's two leaders. The arrests have been criticized as an assault on Turkey's democracy and have drawn condemnations from European capitals and the United Nations. The crackdown on political opponents follows a failed coup attempt in July, with tens of thousands of people being arrested or dismissed from their jobs. The government has also been targeting Kurdish opposition politicians, linking them to Kurdish militant groups. The arrests of HDP lawmakers are seen as a turning point in the government's campaign of arrests and have raised fears of greater instability in the country.	3.2

These schools punished students for speaking their native languages or observing indigenous traditions, and subjected them to physical and sexual assault, medical experimentation, and sterilization.

This means that people on opposite political spectrum cannot see eye-to-eye at all. This makes compromise even worse and less likely to succeed.	"In his first televised sit-down interview since becoming President-elect, Donald Trump told his supporters to stop harassing minorities. He expressed sadness over reports of harassment and urged his supporters to ""stop it."" Trump also criticized the protests that have broken out since his election, calling them ""horrible"" and blaming the press for exaggerating the incidents. He discussed his plans for FBI Director James Comey, saying he hasn't made up his mind about whether to ask for his resignation. Trump also addressed his stance on same-sex marriage, abortion, and deporting undocumented immigrants. He pledged to focus on deporting criminals and building a border wall. Trump defended his transition team, which includes lobbyists, saying that they know the system but will be phased out. He stuck by his claim that he knows more than American generals about fighting ISIS. Trump also expressed support for ditching the Electoral College and handing the presidency to the winner of the popular vote.

The majority of these casualties were caused by airstrikes from a coalition led by Saudi Arabia. At least 329 civilians have been killed and 426 injured since the beginning of August. Saudi Arabia and its allies are trying to prevent an international investigation into possible war crimes. The United States and Britain, major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia, are finding it harder to ignore the bloodshed. The most recent example of the carnage was an airstrike on a market and residential area in Hodeidah, which killed at least 26 civilians. The United Nations has documented numerous attacks on civilian facilities by both coalition and rebel forces. Doctors Without Borders has pulled staff members out of six hospitals in Yemen after coalition planes bombed a facility. The United Nations has also expressed concern over the blockade of the city of Taiz, which has left residents critically short of food and water. The majority of civilian casualties have been caused by the Saudi-led coalition, according to a report to the Human Rights Council. Saudi Arabia and President Hadi's government have condemned the report as biased and have proposed a Yemeni commission to investigate human rights violations. Rights groups argue that a national body lacks expertise and that its reporting falls short of international standards. The European Union has drafted a competing resolution calling for a United Nations mission to Yemen. The Council will decide how to proceed after a week of diplomatic negotiations. President Hadi accused Iran of blocking the path towards peace in Yemen.	6.5

Additionally, 38% of adults say that cultural and political discussions on social media cause them stress. The APA has provided a list of do's and don'ts for reading and reacting to election news.

The Pilcomayo River in Paraguay is experiencing an extensive die-off of caiman, fish, and other river creatures due to a combination of drought and mismanagement. Up to 98% of caimans and 80% of capybaras are suspected dead. The river has dried up for nearly 435 miles and the government has declared an environmental emergency. The mismanagement of water resources and infrastructure by both Paraguay and Argentina has exacerbated the crisis. The river's wandering behavior and the significant amount of sediment it transports downstream have contributed to the blockage and dispersal of the river outside its channel. The government is working to find a solution, but there is no water to release or divert. Zimbabwe plans to sell its wildlife, including elephants and possibly endangered African wild dogs, to replenish its coffers due to cash shortages and a drought. Critics argue that the mismanagement of the economy and lack of accountability make this plan unworkable.

A month after Hurricane Matthew hit southwestern Haiti, the region is facing widespread hunger and destruction. At least 800,000 people urgently need food, but there is not enough aid reaching the affected areas. Truckloads of food and medical supplies have been looted, and desperate crowds have clashed with police. The storm destroyed homes, crops, and livestock, leaving many without shelter or a means to survive. Cholera outbreaks are also occurring due to contaminated water supplies. The United Nations has only raised one-third of the emergency funding needed to help the affected population. The Haitian government, along with international relief organizations, is coordinating efforts to provide assistance, but political obstacles and the upcoming elections pose challenges. The situation is dire, with people sleeping under trees and lacking basic necessities.

It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	Goldfish that are released into the wild can become invasive and cause serious ecological damage. In Australia's Vasse River, goldfish have thrived and grown to large sizes, with some reaching 16 inches and four pounds. Goldfish invasions have also been reported in other places like Nevada, Colorado, and Alberta. The growth rate of goldfish in the Vasse River is the fastest known in the world. The problem with goldfish invasions stems from a disconnect between how people view goldfish as cute pets and their behavior in the wild. Goldfish are capable of rapid reproduction, uprooting vegetation, disturbing sediment, and transmitting diseases and parasites. Eradicating goldfish is difficult once they are established. Recent research has shown that goldfish are long-distance swimmers and migrate to spawn. Understanding goldfish behavior can help inform management strategies. It is crucial for pet owners to responsibly dispose of unwanted fish to prevent further invasions. Flushing fish down the toilet is not recommended.	4.2

Two months prior to her death, she had been referred to mental health services but was not offered any help. The inquest revealed that crucial information about her condition had not been provided to the relevant services. The coroner concluded that there were missed opportunities to help Brampton, but it is uncertain if they would have changed the outcome.

Anyways, this article is illustrating the harm of over pumping water sources in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It sounds like a really terrible situation, with arsenic being a terrible poison that's being pushed around by all of this negligence. You should read it.	Overpumping of groundwater in Dhaka, Bangladesh is causing a water crisis that extends beyond the city center. The pumping has caused groundwater levels to drop significantly over the past 50 years, leading to water quality and supply issues in surrounding peri-urban and rural communities. The presence of naturally occurring arsenic in shallow groundwater further exacerbates the problem. The pumping is causing faster groundwater flow, which can transport contaminants like arsenic to deeper areas of the aquifer, even outside the city limits. This poses a threat to deep wells used for arsenic mitigation in these areas. The researchers used detailed subsurface measurements to model the geology of Dhaka and found that strong pumping and heterogeneity in the underground sediments affect the hydrology of the area. Heterogeneity refers to the way sand and clay are oriented underground and is critical to how contaminants move in groundwater. In a delta system like Bangladesh, the clay layers are chopped up, allowing water to move in unpredictable ways and creating uncertainty about well contamination. The researchers theorize that if pumping continues at current levels, some wells outside the city center could become contaminated sooner than expected. The low water levels caused by pumping could also compromise the operation of handpumps in these areas. Arsenic is tasteless, odorless, and colorless, making it difficult for communities to detect its presence in water without testing. The researchers' models showed that typical hydrogeological data used to assess well safety is not predictive in this type of heterogeneous system. This highlights the need for water quality monitoring and the development of artificial groundwater recharge methods to address the water crisis in the region.	4.2

The US-backed air campaign in Yemen has been accused of war crimes, with rights groups and UN officials stating that the coalition has disregarded civilian casualties and failed to distinguish between civilian and military targets. Nearly 4,000 civilians have been killed in the war, with 60% of them dying in airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition. The war has caused widespread hunger and displacement, and warplanes have targeted medical centers, schools, and infrastructure. The US provides intelligence and logistical help to Saudi Arabia, but has reduced the number of military personnel advising the coalition. The coalition claims to investigate violations, but critics argue that the backing from the US and international community has given them a free rein.

If the current owners of the polar bear agree to this offer, Pizza could be moved to a proper sanctuary and his life of misery would end. “The good news now for Grandview is that they now have the chance to put their mistake right,” Dave Neale, Animal Welfare Director for Animals Asia, said in a statement. “Thanks to this incredible offer from Yorkshire Wildlife Park there can be a happy ending and the negative publicity they have suffered can yet be turned into a positive news story. From talking to them I know they know that mistakes have been made in terms of their animal facilities and on-going care.” China’s	Yorkshire Wildlife Park has offered to rescue a polar bear named Pizza from Guangzhou's Grandview Aquarium. Over half a million supporters signed a petition demanding the closure of the aquarium, which has faced criticism for its treatment of animals. If the current owners agree, Pizza could be moved to a proper sanctuary. The Grandview Aquarium is currently under investigation for the deaths of many animals. Animal welfare organizations, including PETA and Animals Asia, have been campaigning for Pizza's release. Yorkshire Wildlife Park has made the offer to provide a happy ending to the situation.	6.5

I have a four-year bachelor's degree and earn 75000 USD. I thought the article was quite sad to read and disheartening to hear about the Iraqi people. I felt sad for them knowing their future was uncertain and how hard it was to find a job. The economy they deal with is much worse than ours and I can only imagine how difficult it must be living there. I hope that it gets better in the future.	Afghanistan is facing a looming humanitarian crisis as the number of displaced people continues to rise. Over a million people were already uprooted last year, and this year, at least another million Afghans are on the move within the country and across its borders. The violence and conflict in Afghanistan have forced many to flee, while others are escaping poverty and drought. The United Nations and other aid agencies are struggling to provide emergency assistance, and if they fail, it will become a full-blown crisis. The country has been plagued by massive displacement since the Soviet invasion in 1979, and the current violence is some of the worst since the Taliban was toppled. The clashes between Afghan and Taliban forces have pushed even more people from their homes. The government is unable to reach all affected areas, and the Taliban now controls more territory than at any time since 2001. The return of refugees to areas controlled by insurgents is a concern, as it could exacerbate insecurity and joblessness. The displaced are often rejected and forced into squalid camps, with limited access to clean water and food. The situation is dire, and the government is incapable of creating jobs or improving the economy in remote areas. Criminal and terrorist networks may exploit the jobless and displaced youths, further deepening the crisis.	6.5

I hold a four-year bachelor's degree and my annual income is 30000 USD. I know that the affordable care act will effect alot of people out there who are already struggling but this is an issue that just sounds wrong to me. First because so many women that I know who have gotten and IUD had complications and second because the issue of women being able to choose to have an abortion is a bitter conversation to me.	Women are concerned about the potential threat to affordable birth control under the Trump-Pence administration. Trump and Pence have expressed intentions to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which covers birth control. In response, some women are considering getting an intrauterine device (IUD) as a long-lasting form of birth control that could outlast any changes made by the administration. IUDs are highly effective and safe, with some versions lasting up to 12 years. Women are advised to take action soon, as an IUD can cost up to $1,000 without insurance coverage. Planned Parenthood offers a guide for those interested in learning more about IUDs. The fate of the Affordable Care Act and its birth control provisions is uncertain after President Obama leaves office on January 20, 2017.	3.2

I've given up my faith in humanity.  There are just certain events that transpire that make you shudder to the core.  After reading multiple articles today about just how shitty people can be to one another, it makes me beyond happy to know the individuals that are in my own personal life.   Human greed knows no bounds.  Human ego needs to be set aside and/or destroyed.	The text describes an undercover investigation into the exploitation of Syrian refugees and children in the garment industry in Turkey. The investigation reveals that many Syrian refugees, who lack work permits, are forced to work illegally in factories for low wages. The factories often hide workers during audits and continue exploiting them once the auditors leave. Some brands are aware of the abuses and are trying to address them, but others are unaware of the conditions in their supply chain. The investigation concludes that until brands have full visibility into their supply chain, the exploitation of refugees and children is likely to persist.	3.2

Shawn Gill experienced a case of stolen and mistaken identity when someone used his name after a car accident. The actual driver was David Joseph Singer, who had a criminal record. Gill reported the identity theft and filed the necessary paperwork, but his license was still suspended and he lost his job as a driver for Lyft and Uber. Gill appealed the decision but faced difficulties in court due to incorrect police paperwork and testimony. Gill's friend sought help from a journalist to uncover the truth. It is unclear how Singer obtained Gill's ID information, and there are questions about why the incorrect information was not corrected. Gill's lawyer advised him not to talk to the police, but a letter from the officer who made the report could potentially clear Gill's record. The article calls for Commissioner Richard Ross to intervene and resolve the situation.	4.2
