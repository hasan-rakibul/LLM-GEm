R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_1	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_1_1	I don't really feel much of anything when I read about this sort of incident since it happens all the time, I guess if I had to come up with something I would say I feel vaguely annoyed and irritated, I don't see why people can't manage to watch sports games in an orderly, non-violent manner, so the fact that we have to deal with this nonsense every time a popular sporting event happens is irritating.	anger	anger	anger
R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_1	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_1_2	I think that it should not be difficult for people to conduct themselves appropriately, so it is frustrating that this sort of thing happens so often during sporting and other events.	anger	disgust	surprise
R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_2	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_2_1	While I obviously think that it is sad that an animal is dead since I love animals, what I mostly feel reading this story is aggravation.	sadness	sadness	sad
R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_2	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_2_2	It really annoys and worries me that people insist climate change is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere, including in the form of the current extinction crisis.	anger	fear	disgust
R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_2	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_2_3	I know that this particular one was due to a fungus, but it is part of a trend and might be related, so that is what this makes me think of.	neutral	sadness	joy
R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_2	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_2_4	I always feel frustrated and worried about the future whenever I am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives refuse to acknowledge that the problem even exists.	anger	fear	anger
R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_2	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_2_5	It could be fixed, but probably won't be, and that irritates me.	anger	nutral	sad
R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_3	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_3_1	I don't really feel much of anything at all reading this, I think celebrity deaths are so common in the news that it is really difficult to conjure up any emotion about them.	sadness	nutral	surprise

R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_4	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_4_2	I truly believe that there is no reason for anyone to have a gun and wish that the laws would change to make this the case, so I always feel frustrated reading about random shootings.	anger	sadness	sad
R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_4	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_4_3	I hate that we are subject to everyone else's violent whims as long as they can easily purchase a gun, so that makes me feel angry and also worried.	anger	fear	joy
R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_4	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_4_4	I also feel sort of exhausted, since this happens in the news so much it just feels like yet another shooting story I have to be aware of, it's tiring.	sadness	sadness	sad
R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_5	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_5_1	This story specifically doesn't make me feel anything, since I don't know these people and I feel like if I tried to have emotions for every victim of a crime I read about that would just require too much mental effort.	sadness	nutral	disgust
R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_5	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_5_2	In a broader sense however, I feel frustrated and tired of having to deal with men committing acts of violence against women constantly simply because they can, especially in cases like this where there didn't seem to be much prior warning.	anger	disgust	anger
R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_5	R_3lEy7CLfIzh1GHd_5_3	It's irritating because it is such an awful trend, so it makes me feel sort of disgusted with the state of the world in that way.	disgust	disgust	anger

R_2YV6IEQMUgozwQ1_3	R_2YV6IEQMUgozwQ1_3_1	These people argue about who's fault it is, but in the end, we're just moving down a highway together, that we build together, and all these dangerous curves are our own fault.	neutral	sadness	sad
