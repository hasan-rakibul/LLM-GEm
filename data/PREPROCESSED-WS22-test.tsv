Inmates have no say in who they share a cell with, even if the cellmate has a violent history or severe mental illness. If they refuse a cellmate, they are placed in restraints for hours or days. Restraints are also used as punishment for inmates who break rules or get into fights. The conditions in the Special Management Unit (SMU) at Lewisburg are harsh, with inmates spending nearly 24 hours a day in small cells with little room to move. In 2014 and 2015, there were 228 in-cell fights and assaults at Lewisburg, resulting in injuries and even deaths. The use of restraints at Lewisburg has been criticized by inmates, lawyers, and auditors, but the Bureau of Prisons denies any mistreatment. Changes have been made to the SMU, but the use of restraints remains unchanged. Inmates are left with few options: accept a violent cellmate or be restrained.

Hillary Clinton enters the final 15 days of the race safely ahead in states worth more than 270 electoral votes. Indeed, the suspense of this final stretch is less about whether Trump can turn it around than how many down-ballot Republicans he will drag down with him. “Trump is done,” said Republican operative Jim Dornan, who advised the New York businessman in the preparatory stages of his campaign last year. “Barring something completely out of the blue, like Hillary being involved in a murder, I don’t see how he wins.	2.0	6.0	3.0	22.0	100000.0	98	I am a 22-year-old female of Black or African American race.

"With two weeks to go, Donald Trump's chances of winning the election are almost closed. Hillary Clinton is ahead in states worth more than 270 electoral votes. The focus now is on how many down-ballot Republicans Trump will drag down with him. Republican operatives and conservative radio hosts have declared that Trump is done and there is little he can do to turn it around. Trump's deficits in national and swing state polls are unprecedented, and his ground game is weak compared to Clinton's. Early voting numbers in Arizona and the shrinking advantage of Republicans in Florida and North Carolina indicate a potential win for Clinton. However, Democrats are not taking the outcome for granted and are working hard to mobilize voters. Trump's refusal to accept the voting results and his controversial remarks have galvanized Clinton's supporters. Trump's blaming of a globalist conspiracy and claims of a rigged election have raised concerns about the integrity of the election system. Trump's downward spiral has also affected House Republicans and vulnerable Senate candidates. Overall, Republicans are scared and the race has become a ""horror show"" for them."

"At least 26 Afghan civilians were killed and many others injured in airstrikes in Kunduz province, Afghanistan, while NATO and Afghan forces were fighting Taliban fighters. Two American service members also died in ground clashes. Conflicting reports on the number of casualties and no official account of the airstrikes have been provided. Some local officials claim that up to 100 civilians were killed or wounded. The incident is reminiscent of the tragic events in Kunduz last year when a U.S. airstrike mistakenly targeted a hospital, killing 42 patients and staff members. NATO officials have not confirmed the reported deaths of the civilians. Angry relatives of the victims attempted to protest, but were stopped by security forces. U.S. military officials confirmed the deaths of the two American service members and stated their commitment to helping Afghan partners defend their nation. The NATO mission in Afghanistan issued a statement referring to airstrikes by ""friendly forces"" but did not confirm any civilian casualties. The Taliban claimed that three of their fighters were targeted and killed, along with a large number of civilians."

"Terry Jones, an original member of Monty Python, has been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia, a variant of frontotemporal dementia. This illness affects his ability to communicate, and he is no longer able to give interviews. Despite his condition, Jones will still be recognized for his Outstanding Contribution to Film and Television at an awards ceremony in Cardiff. Primary progressive aphasia is a rare syndrome that affects a person's ability to express thoughts and find words. The news of Jones's diagnosis has saddened fans and garnered support from fellow Monty Python member Eric Idle. Jones, known for his work in Monty Python and films such as ""Life of Brian"" and ""The Meaning of Life,"" has also directed dramas and released a documentary on the economy."

The Pilcomayo River in Paraguay is experiencing an extensive die-off of caiman, fish, and other river creatures due to a combination of drought and mismanagement. Up to 98% of caimans and 80% of capybaras are suspected dead. The river has dried up for nearly 435 miles and the government has declared an environmental emergency. The mismanagement of water resources and infrastructure by both Paraguay and Argentina has exacerbated the crisis. The river's wandering behavior and the significant amount of sediment it transports downstream have contributed to the blockage and dispersal of the river outside its channel. The government is working to find a solution, but there is no water to release or divert. Zimbabwe plans to sell its wildlife, including elephants and possibly endangered African wild dogs, to replenish its coffers due to cash shortages and a drought. Critics argue that the mismanagement of the economy and lack of accountability make this plan unworkable. South Australia has been hit by a destructive storm just 24 hours after a super cell thunderstorm knocked out the state's entire power network. The storm caused heavy rain, flooding, and major damage, and left thousands without power.

The Chicago Police Department is facing a digital archive that documents two decades of torture by its officers. The archive, called the Chicago Torture Archive, contains over 10,000 documents related to cases of torture between 1972 and 1991. These cases involved over 100 black men who were tortured by police officers to force confessions or intimidate witnesses. The archive, which will be housed at the University of Chicago, includes interrogations, trial files, journalism works, and records of activism. The launch of the archive coincides with recent efforts in Chicago to address police misconduct, including the passing of the Reparations for Burge Torture Victims ordinance. The archive's director hopes that the lessons learned from these cases can inform and inspire young activists. While the archive provides a comprehensive resource for studying the cases, there are concerns about privacy and whether victims and their families were made aware of the archive's existence. Despite these concerns, the archive is seen as an essential tool for academics, researchers, and historians to understand this dark chapter in Chicago's history. It also presents an opportunity for the police department to mend relationships with residents and increase transparency and accountability.

The Zika virus has been known to scientists for decades, but it has only recently become a serious public health concern. The majority of infected individuals do not experience symptoms, making it difficult to test for. Pregnant women are particularly at risk, as the virus can cause birth defects. Zika primarily spreads through infected mosquitoes, but it can also be transmitted through sexual contact. There is currently no vaccine or treatment for Zika, but scientists are making progress in developing them. The virus is prevalent in many countries, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Zika was first discovered in monkeys in Uganda in 1947 and has since spread to various parts of the world. In the United States, there have been thousands of cases, with Puerto Rico being heavily affected. The CDC has issued travel warnings for Zika in many countries.

Economists attribute this decline to burdensome regulations and a weak job market. Some argue that the US's focus on individual self-reliance and smaller social safety net may discourage risk-taking. Studies show that demand-side factors, such as job insecurity and middling wage growth, are affecting entrepreneurship. Canada's maternity leave reform and France's unemployment insurance reform offer potential solutions to boost entrepreneurship. Policies that promote a tight labor market and full employment are crucial for the future strength of the US economy."

Maybe thy fear that they will spread disease but an alternative needs to happen. Those people should have the right to donate blood as long as they don't carry disease.	Gay men are unable to donate blood to victims of the Orlando shooting due to a year-long celibacy requirement imposed by the FDA. These regulations were implemented in 2015, supposedly ending the ban on gay men's blood, but still prevent even monogamous gay men from donating. The ban originated in 1983 during the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but the American Medical Association has called for its end, stating it is discriminatory and lacks scientific basis. Misinformation spread on social media falsely claimed the ban had been lifted in Orlando. The ban is seen as unjustified, and other countries, like Argentina, have already abolished it. The Council on American-Islamic Relations is helping to maintain blood supplies. The article calls for the end of this oppressive policy and highlights the need for continued resistance in the face of tragedy.

They have to find a way in order to make things more affordable.	Venezuelan children are fainting and falling asleep in school due to hunger. Many students are absent because their families cannot afford to buy food. One teacher reported that a student skipped class every Thursday because it was their family's designated day to buy food at government-regulated prices. Another teacher witnessed a child faint during a cultural event because they had only eaten an arepa at 10 a.m. and it was already 3 p.m. The government spends very little on meals in public schools, and a lawmaker criticized the government for prioritizing weapons over food. A recent poll revealed that 48% of the time children do not attend school, it is due to food-related issues. Many children eat only twice a day or even just once, and for some, the school lunch is their only meal of the day. Some parents are considering changing their children from private to public schools, while others are contemplating taking their children out of school altogether. In addition to the food crisis, public schools are also facing infrastructure problems, with stolen computers and desks and a lack of funds for school supplies.

Many of them are facing difficult circumstances, including food and medicine shortages, as well as neglect from their families. The siege imposed by pro-government forces has made it nearly impossible to find medicine to treat chronic diseases commonly experienced by older people. Overstretched medical facilities are unable to provide proper care, leading to more deaths. Some families have even abandoned their older family members due to the extreme conditions. The situation has left many older residents feeling weak, frightened, and helpless. Despite the dangers, some refuse to leave their homes, while others are trapped and unable to leave due to the siege. The older residents of Aleppo are struggling to balance their own needs with the demands of their families, often sacrificing their own well-being. The war has taken away their dignity and left them feeling isolated and afraid.

Scientists felt it would take a lot longer to get the point we're at right now, we don't have time to wait and need to make a change now!	A new study in Science reveals that global warming has already affected every aspect of life on Earth, from genes to entire ecosystems. With just a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, major impacts are already being felt in natural systems. More than 80% of ecological processes that support healthy marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems show signs of responses to climate change. These impacts have consequences for humans, including increased pests and disease outbreaks, unpredictable changes in fisheries, and decreasing agriculture yields. Understanding the adaptive capacity in nature can help address these issues and apply the same principles to crops, livestock, and aquacultural species. The study emphasizes the need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as there are already significant and widespread impacts from climate change across biological systems.

This hurts the regrowth process if no is there to support it. People need to be able to know that there's still hope in Louisiana and that it's safe to return and rebuild there. The community will only get stronger with people staying and helping each other.	The flood-ravaged state of Louisiana may face a population loss as residents consider leaving after the flood waters recede. While few people have confirmed their departure, it is a topic of discussion among many. The state's economy will suffer if there is a decline in population, as it will reduce spending and tax revenue. Louisiana experienced a 6% population decrease after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, taking over five years to recover. Although this year's exodus is unlikely to be as severe, the shortage of available housing and the closure of small businesses due to the flooding pose challenges. Additionally, the decline in oil industry jobs and the state's high unemployment rate further complicate the situation. The aid and insurance money that typically accompanies natural disasters may not be enough to prevent people from leaving, exacerbating an already struggling economy.

This then trickles down to how humans are able to cope. We need strong change quickly to safe the ecosystem which will helps us in the long run as well.	Climate change has had a broad impact on ecosystems, with evidence of its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. A study identified 94 core ecological processes, of which 82% showed evidence of impact from climate change. These impacts range from shifts in species ranges and changes in phenology to disruptions at the genetic and ecosystem levels. Species are adapting to temperature extremes, with changes in physiology and morphology. Changes in phenology, abundance, and distribution of species have also been observed. These impacts have implications for food security, as reduced genetic diversity, inconsistent crop yields, and decreased productivity in fisheries threaten resources. Changes in disease vectors and the emergence of novel pathogens and pests pose a direct threat to human health and resources. Understanding these impacts is crucial for adapting to and mitigating the influence of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

The battle against the Islamic State has resulted in soldiers and civilians being injured or killed by chlorine gas, mortar fire, bombs, and artillery shells. The presence of civilians in the city has made the fight more difficult for Iraqi forces and airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition. The Islamic State has been using civilians as human shields, preventing them from leaving the city. The medical station on the outskirts of Mosul is treating injured civilians, but many are unable to reach medical assistance. The fight for Mosul is expected to be prolonged, putting more civilians at risk. The Iraqi military does not release overall casualty figures, but the toll is likely much higher than reported.

While the virus has infected over 650,000 people in the region, the majority of babies born with congenital neurological damage linked to Zika have been clustered in northeastern Brazil. Health officials and scientists are investigating other factors that may be contributing to the higher toll in this region, such as the presence of other mosquito-borne viruses or environmental and genetic factors. The number of cases of birth defects linked to Zika outside of Brazil has been relatively low, leading researchers to caution that it will take years to fully understand the dangers the virus poses to babies' brains. The outbreak in Puerto Rico is being closely monitored, but the mainland United States has so far averted a major outbreak. The lack of funding for Zika research and prevention has hindered efforts to accurately count the number of people infected and assess the true impact of the virus.

Wind turbines are not only killing local birds, but also birds from hundreds of miles away, according to researchers from Purdue University and the U.S. Geological Survey. Using DNA and stable isotopes, the researchers found that golden eagles killed at a wind farm in California can come from far distances. This raises concerns about the impact of wind farms on bird populations. The Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) in California, one of the oldest and largest wind farms in the world, has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of birds. The researchers found that eagles are attracted to the area due to the abundance of prey and the windy conditions, but fail to see the turbine blades and get hit. The study also revealed that a large percentage of the birds killed are from neighboring states, highlighting the need for environmental assessments to consider the impact on the entire population. The findings have implications for the management of wind energy facilities and the conservation of bird species.

"Sally Brampton, the founding editor of Elle magazine in the UK, took her own life after health professionals failed to offer her help, according to an inquest. Brampton, who had a long battle with depression, drowned after walking into the sea near her home. She had sought help from a psychiatrist and GP but did not receive the assistance she needed. Two months prior to her death, she had been referred to mental health services but was not offered any help. The inquest revealed that crucial information about her condition had not been provided to the relevant services. The coroner concluded that there were missed opportunities to help Brampton, but it is uncertain if they would have changed the outcome. The mental health services have since made changes and no longer use faxes. Brampton was a respected journalist and author, known for her book ""Shoot the Damn Dog"" about her battle with depression."

This was an interesting article about ways that this extinction could have been prevented. I am curious about how they determine the exact causation in some of their assessments. I found it interesting that they conclude at the end that humans could have prevented the extinction (and that it is implicitly ok to stop such an event).	The Bramble Cay melomys, a reddish-brown rodent, recently made international news when it was declared extinct. While climate change played a role in its demise, human inaction was the ultimate cause. Rising sea levels due to climate change destroyed the melomys' habitat and food sources. However, it was revealed that Australian researchers had planned to start a captive breeding program for the melomys, but they were unable to find any individuals on Bramble Cay. This missed opportunity highlights the tragedy that had been unfolding for years. In a new paper, biologist John Woinarski and colleagues argue that the extinction of the melomys, along with two other Australian species, could have been prevented. The Christmas Island pipistrelle and Christmas Island forest skink also suffered from human neglect and inaction, allowing introduced predators to decimate their populations. Australia's biodiversity conservation law lacks explicit commitment to preventing human-caused extinctions, leaving species vulnerable. These extinctions are often overlooked due to the small size and remote locations of the species. Australia has the highest rate of mammal extinctions in the world, with 30 species lost since European colonization. Woinarski's assessment is driven by personal grief and a desire to learn from past mistakes. Australia still has over a thousand threatened and endangered species, and action is needed to prevent further extinctions. While climate change did contribute to the melomys' extinction, it is important to recognize the other environmental factors and the human choice to not save the species.

Gay men are unable to donate blood to victims of the Orlando shooting due to a year-long celibacy requirement imposed by the FDA. These regulations were implemented in 2015, supposedly ending the ban on gay men's blood, but still prevent even monogamous gay men from donating. The ban originated in 1983 during the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but the American Medical Association has called for its end, stating it is discriminatory and lacks scientific basis. Misinformation spread on social media falsely claimed the ban had been lifted in Orlando. The ban is seen as unjustified, and other countries, like Argentina, have already abolished it. The Council on American-Islamic Relations is helping to maintain blood supplies. The article calls for the end of this oppressive policy and highlights the need for continued resistance in the face of tragedy.

The mental health care provided to detainees at Guantánamo Bay has been compromised by a lack of training, ethical boundaries, and information about their treatment during interrogations. Psychiatrists and psychologists were often unaware of the abuse that had taken place, and were discouraged from asking detainees about their experiences. The quality of care has been criticized by human rights groups and defense teams, who argue that it has been negligent and ineffective. Many detainees suffer from psychological problems as a result of their treatment, but PTSD is rarely diagnosed due to the impracticality of treatment in the prison environment. The mental health personnel faced numerous challenges, including distrust from detainees and the blurred lines between medical care and interrogation. Despite these obstacles, they did their best to provide care to the prisoners.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man responsible for the bombings in Manhattan and on the Jersey Shore, had been planning the attacks for months and was inspired by international terrorists, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The complaint details the extent of the damage caused by the bombs, including shattered windows and victims with ball bearings and metal fragments in their bodies. It was also revealed that Rahami's father had previously expressed concerns to the authorities about his son's potential involvement in terrorism, but no further action was taken. Rahami's notebook, recovered after he was shot and wounded by the police, contained writings expressing his extremist Islamic ideology and admiration for terrorist figures. The complaint also mentions that Rahami had been acquiring materials for his weapons through eBay. The investigation is ongoing to determine if Rahami had any assistance in building the bombs.

These fires have burned over 107,000 acres, with 37 fires covering at least 100 acres each. Arson is suspected in some cases. The fires have caused a hazy pall over northern Georgia, and officials have warned of unhealthy air quality. State firefighters are working to contain the fires and have urged people to avoid starting new ones. The drought has also affected water levels, with a popular state park's main attraction reduced to a trickle.

The UN reports that tens of thousands of civilians have been abducted by ISIS in Mosul and used as human shields. The group has also killed former security service members and civilians who refused to obey their orders. Iraqi, Kurdish, and allied forces are advancing to retake Mosul, but there are concerns that ISIS will use the remaining 1.5 million people in the city to defend themselves. Reports suggest that civilians have been forced from their homes and relocated inside the city since the offensive began. ISIS is preventing families from fleeing to territory held by the Iraqi army and targeting those suspected of disloyalty.

All that pain of your skin just eating away at itself only to die? I wouldn't wish it on any creature.	Red squirrels in the UK have been found to carry leprosy, a disease that was eradicated in humans in Britain centuries ago. The squirrels were found to have two different species of leprosy bacterium, one of which is almost identical to a strain recovered from a medieval human skeleton. There is currently no evidence of squirrel-to-human transmission, but researchers are concerned about the health of the endangered red squirrels. The reason why squirrels, humans, and armadillos are the only known species to harbor the bacterium is still unknown. The discovery of leprosy in squirrels may help researchers understand how the disease manifests in humans and how it spreads.

Think of how many women worldwide are taking the pill, this could be seriously troublesome. I can't believe there isn't more alarm about this and that I'd never heard about it before now. Make sure you tell everyone you know, we have to get the word out!	A study from the University of Copenhagen has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The study, which tracked one million Danish women for 13 years, found that women taking the combined oral contraceptive were 23% more likely to be diagnosed with depression, while those using progestin-only pills were 34% more likely. Teens were at the greatest risk, with an 80% increase in depression when taking the combined pill. Other hormone-based methods, such as the hormonal IUS/coil, the patch, and the ring, were shown to increase depression at a higher rate than oral contraceptives. The study suggests that the practice of encouraging teens to use these alternatives to the pill is misguided. The medical community's response to the study has been dismissive, with experts downplaying the link and offering paternalistic advice. The burden of avoiding unwanted pregnancy falls on women, despite the potential negative effects on their health and wellbeing. Effective alternatives to hormonal contraceptives exist, but they are often overlooked. It is important to remember that women are twice as likely to experience depression as men, and blaming women's depression on their biological femaleness is acceptable, but blaming medication formulated from synthetic hormones is not. The study's authors plan to research the possible association between hormonal birth control and suicide attempts or completions. While not every woman experiences depression and anxiety from hormonal contraceptives, it is important to acknowledge that many do, and their lives could be improved by recognizing and addressing this issue.

It seems as though the chances of getting anything done that will really help toward reversing the trend, toward trying to restore the ecosystems and species that are already being affected, when a large portion of the country doesn't think any of it is real.	A new study in Science reveals that global warming has already affected every aspect of life on Earth, from genes to entire ecosystems. With just a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, major impacts are already being felt in natural systems. More than 80% of ecological processes that support healthy marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems show signs of responses to climate change. These impacts have consequences for humans, including increased pests and disease outbreaks, unpredictable changes in fisheries, and decreasing agriculture yields. Understanding the adaptive capacity in nature can help address these issues and apply the same principles to crops, livestock, and aquacultural species. The study emphasizes the need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as there are already significant and widespread impacts from climate change across biological systems.

The scientists criticize politicians and real estate developers without scientific experience who deny climate change. They express sadness that the Republican Party, historically supportive of environmental initiatives, is now rejecting climate science. The scientists emphasize the economic and social costs of inaction and call for rational decision-making to manage climate change risks. They also criticize the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, for wanting to scrap environmental agreements. The scientists highlight the success of renewable energy sources in reducing emissions and argue that action to reduce pollution does not harm the economy.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) released its annual global gender gap report, revealing that the US has slipped to 45th place in terms of gender equality. This decline is attributed to a decrease in women's participation in the labor force and a shrinking number of women in senior positions. However, the US has closed its education gender gap. Globally, progress towards economic equality has slowed, with the gender pay gap persisting and women's labor force participation lower than men's. The report warns that the global economic gender gap is not expected to close until 2196. The lack of progress in economic equality is concerning, as jobs typically held by women are at risk due to technological disruption. The top-ranking countries in terms of gender equality are predominantly Scandinavian. The Global Gender Gap Index ranks countries based on the distribution of resources between men and women.

Management and ownership at a Saskatoon dog kennel were warned about multiple serious problems with their animal care methods before the death of 14 large breed dogs. The kennel was warned about ventilation problems, among other issues, by a certified master trainer and kennel care expert. The SPCA also received a copy of the complaints but is unable to pursue them due to lack of power. The dogs died of heat exhaustion after a malfunction in the building's heating system caused the room they were in to become excessively hot. The kennel manager expressed remorse and stated that the upper-floor room where the deaths occurred has been closed off. The kennel will remain open. The kennel had previously received positive reviews from customers, but the trainer who raised concerns said that customers don't see the full picture. The trainer quit after management refused his suggestions and took his list of concerns to the SPCA. The SPCA is part of a coalition urging the provincial Ministry of Agriculture to reform legislation to better protect animals.

I feel that Zika is still a threat to many and I feel that it's a shame that the need for vaccinations abate's after such a short time. There is no way of telling when these diseases can strike again and more people will be harmed. I believe it's up to the government to mandate that we have vaccinations on hand. And that should also go for the West Nile Virus and other strains of disease that have affected people worldwide. It's better that we are prepared to help not just our own citizens, but people all across the globe. We are the richest country in the world and I expect more from us in this regard.	The future of the Zika virus is uncertain. Experts have different opinions on how long it will stick around and how often it will return. Some believe it will behave like other arboviruses, recurring regularly with upticks in cases during the rainy season. Others predict that it will vanish in a few years, similar to chikungunya. The current outbreak in the Americas is due to the fact that people in the region had no immunity to the virus. Future outbreaks may be smaller if people develop immunity, but there could also be long lulls between outbreaks, allowing for a buildup of younger people who aren't immune. It is unclear if there will be fewer cases of microcephaly in the future due to the immunity gained from Zika infections. The impact of mosquito control efforts on young girls getting infected is also uncertain. It is unknown if Zika will strike Africa and Asia with the same ferocity as the Americas, but experts believe the two strains of Zika will be cross-protective. The uncertainty surrounding Zika's future affects the prospects for a vaccine. If Zika activity subsides, it will be difficult to conduct clinical trials to prove the vaccine's effectiveness. However, the fear of the virus's impact on developing fetuses may continue to drive demand for a vaccine.

The lack of bike lanes in Johannesburg has led to dangerous conditions for cyclists, with many fatalities. The new mayor, Herman Mashaba, halted the construction of new bike lanes due to the cost and prioritization of basic services for the poor. Opponents argue that bike lanes symbolize a city that is not designed for everyone, while proponents see them as a way to address historical inequalities and create a more livable city. However, the implementation of bike lanes has been problematic, with misuse by taxis and cars parking in them. The issue became a political target, with bike lanes being criticized as a symbol of decadence and out-of-touch thinking. Despite the controversy, some cyclists, like Dan Khumalo, appreciate the presence of bike lanes as it makes their commutes safer.

Eye injuries in youth sports are common and often involve activities that are not typically considered risky for eyes, according to a study of emergency room visits related to eye problems among athletes. The study found that about 30,000 sports-related eye injuries were treated each year at participating emergency rooms, with a majority occurring in people younger than 18. Basketball was the sport most likely to result in eye injuries, followed by baseball, softball, air guns, cycling, and soccer. While most injuries were minor, some required surgery and threatened athletes' vision. The study suggests that protective eyewear, such as wraparound glasses, could help prevent these injuries.

Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, is facing a tough re-election fight after years of comfortable victories. His decision to embrace Donald Trump has worsened his chances of winning. His opponent, Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel, has received significant financial support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Issa has tried to fight back by highlighting accusations made against Applegate by his former wife. In another California district, Representative Jeff Denham is also facing a tough re-election fight. Denham, like Issa, has expressed support for Trump. Both districts have a large and growing Latino population, which is expected to vote against Trump. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC have invested over $4 million to defeat Issa and Denham. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, has given over $1.6 million to Denham. Denham's refusal to disavow Trump has put him at odds with the editorial board of The Modesto Bee, the largest newspaper in his district, which has endorsed his opponent, Michael Eggman.

He allegedly stabbed 10 people before being shot dead by an off-duty police officer. Adan was wearing a private security uniform and asked at least one person if they were Muslim while carrying out the stabbings. Although an ISIS-affiliated media outlet claimed responsibility, there is no evidence linking Adan to the terrorist group. Adan was described as a quiet and studious young man from a well-known local Somali family. He had recently called his soccer coach for weight-loss advice and was out of work after his part-time security guard job ended. Investigators are examining Adan's media accounts and electronic devices to determine his motive.

Is it, as they say, the change in biodiversity? How animals are evolving? What's the deal here?	Climate change has had a broad impact on ecosystems, with evidence of its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. A study identified 94 core ecological processes, of which 82% showed evidence of impact from climate change. These impacts range from shifts in species ranges and changes in phenology to disruptions at the genetic and ecosystem levels. Species are adapting to temperature extremes, with changes in physiology and morphology. Changes in phenology, abundance, and distribution of species have also been observed. These impacts have implications for food security, as reduced genetic diversity, inconsistent crop yields, and decreased productivity in fisheries threaten resources. Changes in disease vectors and the emergence of novel pathogens and pests pose a direct threat to human health and resources. Understanding these impacts is crucial for adapting to and mitigating the influence of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

It is estimated that 8 million Americans suffer from PTSD, with rates among Vietnam War and Iraq War veterans being particularly high. The negative connotations surrounding PTSD prevent many veterans from seeking help. Veterans want others to know that referring to them as ""weak"" is ignorant, as war experiences are incomprehensible to those who haven't lived through them. PTSD symptoms can be masked and go unnoticed, making it difficult to recognize. Many PTSD sufferers suffer in silence, fearing judgment and trying to appear strong. Contrary to popular belief, PTSD does not make individuals violent. Recovery from PTSD is possible, and veterans encourage others to seek help and know that they are not alone."

This incident brings attention to the attacks on priests in Mexico, with two others being found shot to death after being kidnapped. While robbery is suggested as the motive for the killings, fellow priests believe there may be other factors involved. The priest had been threatened recently due to his activism and criticism of corruption and crime in the area. This incident sparked unrest in the town of Catemaco, where residents demanded the priest's release. Mexico has seen the killing of 31 priests since 2006, with Veracruz, Guerrero, and Mexico states being the most dangerous for priests due to drug cartel violence.

Although the twins were initially okay, LaKira later experienced complications and lost the pregnancy. The incident raises legal and moral questions about when life begins and whether the twins' deaths should be considered homicides. LaKira's family is struggling to cope with the loss, and they are waiting for the twins' bodies to be released for cremation. The city has recorded 121 homicides this year, and the twins' deaths will be counted as homicides if an arrest is made.

Adam Crapser, a South Korean man who was adopted by an American couple when he was 3 years old, is being deported back to South Korea. Crapser has spent 37 of his 41 years in the United States and has a family there. However, he is being held in an immigration detention center and will be deported as soon as the necessary arrangements are made. Crapser's life in the United States has been difficult, including being abandoned by his adoptive parents and experiencing abuse in subsequent foster homes. He has also had a criminal record, which makes him eligible for deportation. The deportation is a result of his adoptive parents and the adoption agency failing to register him for U.S. citizenship. Many intercountry adoptees face this issue, and Congress is currently considering a bill that would grant citizenship to all children adopted by U.S. citizens. Crapser hopes that the bill will pass, but it will be too late for him. The Adoptee Rights Campaign and others find his deportation appalling and are urging the community to call members of Congress to support a legislative fix.

This article opened my eyes to the other side of Gold Fish. I usually thought of this species as harmless, cute, and nature growing species. Getting to know the serious consequences or havoc they cause to the marine life or ecosystem, in general, is unsettling.  The best way to reduce the Goldfish menace is to dispose of them properly.	Goldfish that are released into the wild can become invasive and cause serious ecological damage. In Australia's Vasse River, goldfish have thrived and grown to large sizes, with some reaching 16 inches and four pounds. Goldfish invasions have also been reported in other places like Nevada, Colorado, and Alberta. The growth rate of goldfish in the Vasse River is the fastest known in the world. The problem with goldfish invasions stems from a disconnect between how people view goldfish as cute pets and their behavior in the wild. Goldfish are capable of rapid reproduction, uprooting vegetation, disturbing sediment, and transmitting diseases and parasites. Eradicating goldfish is difficult once they are established. Recent research has shown that goldfish are long-distance swimmers and migrate to spawn. Understanding goldfish behavior can help inform management strategies. It is crucial for pet owners to responsibly dispose of unwanted fish to prevent further invasions. Flushing fish down the toilet is not recommended.

Right from the campaigning period, I have never been in support of the wall-building due to a lot of reasons. It is capital-intensive, and there are a lot of important issues to fight using that amount of fund.	Mexico is bracing for the consequences of a Trump presidency, as his campaign promises of building a wall, renegotiating trade deals, and deporting Mexican immigrants threaten the country's economy and relationship with the US. The peso has already suffered a significant drop, and experts predict a turbulent financial future for Mexico. The election has also caused an existential crisis for Mexico, as it reflects the negative image the country has in the US. Canada is also concerned about the impact of Trump's presidency, particularly on trade. While some Canadians reacted with anxiety, others saw it as an opportunity for pride. The election has forced Mexico to rethink its relationship with the US, and President Peña Nieto has expressed his willingness to work with Trump. However, paying for a wall is out of Mexico's vision, and the country hopes to continue collaborating with the US for mutual development. The election will likely have the most profound impact on the economy, as the US and Mexico are deeply integrated in terms of trade and employment. Mexico is America's third-largest trading partner, and millions of American jobs are tied to trade with Mexico. Trump's argument that Mexico benefits more from NAFTA than the US resonated with some voters, but experts believe that Mexico has little leverage to apply pressure in the relationship. An economic crisis in Mexico could lead to a migration crisis, as Mexicans may seek work in the US. However, some believe that the threat from the outside will bring Mexicans together and encourage them to work harder. There is optimism that Trump's hostile talk will diminish once he takes office, and that economic factors will temper his policies towards Mexico. However, with the Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump's victory signals an ideological realignment in the US.

This little tips will go a long way to ensure that children feel comfortable opening up to you about the issues or problems they have. Most parents default on these little tips, notwithstanding its importance.	According to new government data, the rate of suicide deaths among children aged 10 to 14 has doubled since 2007. However, deaths from motor vehicle traffic and homicide have decreased over the same time period. Younger children may attempt suicide impulsively due to bad relationships with family and friends, while older children may do so because of relationship issues. Warning signs for suicide in children include increased sadness, irritability, anger, loss of interest in friends or activities, and saying mean or derogatory things. It is important for parents to talk to their children and listen to their feelings. There is limited research on suicide in children, and experts hope that the report will raise awareness and lead to more prevention efforts.

The text highlights the ongoing disaster in Haiti caused by Hurricane Matthew, which has received little media coverage compared to previous disasters. The hurricane has caused significant material damage, including the destruction of houses, crops, and trees, as well as a spike in cholera cases. The lack of urgency and support from the central government and international agencies has frustrated local officials and community organizations. The slow response has led to desperation among the affected population, with some resorting to looting.

Lesin, who helped create the Kremlin's Russia Today television network, was found dead in a D.C. hotel room in November 2015. Initially ruled as ""undetermined,"" the manner of death has now been amended to an accident with acute ethanol intoxication as a contributing cause. Lesin's death was caused by blunt-force injuries to his head, as well as injuries to his neck, torso, arms, and legs from falls. The investigation determined that Lesin entered his hotel room for the final time after days of excessive alcohol consumption and was found dead the next morning. The ruling of accidental death has been accepted by the interim D.C. police chief. Lesin was known for his role in the Kremlin-dominated media landscape and his volatile temper. He resigned as head of Gazprom-Media in 2014 and kept a low profile until his death.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended his surprise ban on most currency in circulation in India, which has caused chaos and inconvenience for millions of people. Modi argued that the ban was necessary to fight corruption and reduce the use of unaccounted-for cash in the country. However, opposition leaders and many citizens have criticized the move, as people have faced long lines at banks and ATMs, and many machines have run out of cash. Despite the hardships, some individuals expressed support for the ban, believing that it will ultimately benefit the nation. The transition to new currency notes has been complicated by the fact that many ATMs are not working and cannot dispense the new notes. The Finance Ministry reported that Indians have deposited about $45 billion in banned currency notes since the policy began, while banks and ATMs have given out $7.5 billion in new currency notes. The ban has had a significant impact on businesses, with sales falling and customers unable to pay with cash. While some individuals believe the ban is necessary, others argue that it is causing unnecessary suffering for the poor and that the real black money is hidden in Swiss bank accounts.

Three anti-poaching rangers, including two South Africans and a Mozambican, were attacked by angry villagers in Mozambique after apprehending a poacher. The rangers, including Sean van Niekerk, were whipped, stabbed, and pelted with rocks. Van Niekerk suffered a minor skull fracture, stab wounds, and injuries to his face and back. Despite the incident, he remains committed to saving wildlife. The attack occurred when the rangers were transporting the poacher to the police station and a mob from the community approached them. The police officers who were present fled, leaving the rangers to defend themselves until a helicopter arrived. Van Niekerk hopes that sharing this story will expose the incompetence and corruption of the police officers involved.

Consumer Reports has released a report identifying fifteen supplement ingredients that can cause illness or even death. The risks associated with these ingredients include cancer, organ damage, and cardiac arrest. The severity of the threats depends on factors such as pre-existing conditions, the quantity of ingredients taken, and the length of exposure. The report lists the dangerous ingredients, including aconite, caffeine powder, chaparral, coltsfoot, comfrey, germander, greater celandine, green tea extract powder, Kava, lobelia, methylsynephrine, pennyroyal oil, red yeast rice, usnic acid, and Yohimbe. The report warns against the use of these ingredients due to their potential health risks. The CDC has reported that the use of dietary supplements in the United States is common, with over forty percent of the population using them from 1998 to 2004. Multivitamins and multiminerals are the most commonly used products.

Elizabeth Rose, who manages male models at Premier, believes it is unfair and not a form of female empowerment. She explains that women can be paid up to £40,000 for a top show, while male models only receive £10,000 on average. However, she notes that the situation is slowly changing as advertisers are increasingly using male models for grooming products. Elizabeth also highlights that the top 10 female models all make millions, whereas only the top three male models earn over a million. She tries to negotiate higher fees for male models but acknowledges that women face more discrimination due to their age. Elizabeth believes that change can happen if more agents and models refuse to accept unequal pay.

Millions of trees across the United States are dying due to a combination of factors including disease, insects, drought, and wildfires, all exacerbated by climate change. One example is the rapid ohi'a death disease in Hawaii, which has infected nearly 50,000 acres of native forest. The cause of this disease is still unknown, and scientists are struggling to find a treatment. In California, an invasive pathogen called Sudden Oak Death is killing millions of trees, including redwoods. Bark beetles and mountain pine beetles are also wreaking havoc on forests, expanding their range due to climate change. The loss of trees has far-reaching consequences, affecting clean water, carbon storage, and entire ecosystems. Scientists are working on genetic research to understand why some trees are able to survive these threats, but they warn that in a few decades, American forests may be unrecognizable.

A survey conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA) found that 52% of Americans consider the 2016 Presidential Election to be a significant source of stress. This stress is not limited to any particular political party and is exacerbated by social media posts, which can range from factual to inflammatory. Additionally, 38% of adults say that cultural and political discussions on social media cause them stress. The APA has provided a list of do's and don'ts for reading and reacting to election news. The stress trend is expected to continue until mid-November, as more people rely on online sources for news. While cable TV news remains the top source of election news, more millennials are turning to alternative sources for information.

Pakistan is expelling over 100 Turkish schoolteachers at the request of Turkey's President Erdogan. The expulsion is seen as an appeasement to Erdogan's demand to close schools linked to exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan accuses of orchestrating a coup attempt. Turkey has arrested tens of thousands of people suspected of ties to Gulen since the coup, and Erdogan has pressured other countries to aid in the crackdown. Pakistan is one of the few countries to comply. The affected schools deny any affiliation with political organizations and are petitioning against the expulsions.

Wildfires near the Georgia-North Carolina line have led to evacuations and the need for residents to wear masks outdoors. The largest wildfire has burned over 13,000 acres and is only 20% contained. Special health masks are being distributed in North Carolina as regular surgical masks do not provide enough protection from smoke particles. Despite the smoke, the Charlotte Marathon was able to proceed as planned. Many of the wildfires are suspected arsons, with a dark blue SUV being sought in one case. In Tennessee, 72% of active wildfires are suspected arsons. In North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, over 20 wildfires are being investigated for suspected arson.

Ranaviruses, which can infect amphibians, reptiles, and fish, have devastated common frog populations. The research indicates that infected animals from aquatic retailers or the movement of species between ponds may be worsening the problem. The virus appears to be spreading faster than frogs can hop, and human-aided dispersal is likely involved. Ranaviruses are a group of viruses found worldwide, and they can kill common frogs by causing sores and blisters on their skin or internal bleeding. Genetic records suggest that ranavirus was introduced to the UK on two separate occasions. Garden ponds can act as stepping stones for infected animals to reach new sites, and the transfer of frogspawn or frogs between ponds may be aiding the spread of the virus. The study emphasizes the need to manage the risk of disease outbreaks while still supporting wildlife by adding ponds to urban gardens. Limiting the movement of potentially-infectious material is strongly advised.

There was a Trump protest that resulted in SWAT teams coming in (or maybe it was the police) and trying to contain the protest and to keep it from getting out of hand. There were fires being set and general loud mobs and disturbances. This happened in Oakland, which I know has seen it's fair share of riots and protests. From the article, it doesn't seem as though anyone was hurt, killed, or that there was too much property damage. They really didn't go into too much detail about what the protest was about either. I can definitely sympathize with the desire to protest against his policies, but I think that a violent protest on the part of the public sends the wrong image and message to the other side. They'll just say that the protesters are unruly, lawless, and they need to keep themselves	Protesters in Oakland caused damage to businesses during anti-Trump demonstrations. At least 11 people were arrested as protesters set fires, smashed windows, and sprayed graffiti on seven businesses. Police in riot gear attempted to control the crowd's access to the city's central business district. The number of protesters decreased from 1,000 to a few hundred by the end of the night.

A new study reveals that 28.6% of cancer deaths in the United States are caused by smoking. The research considered 12 smoking-related cancers and found that smoking is involved in 22.9% of cancer deaths in women and 33.7% in men. In 2014, an estimated 167,133 people died from smoking-related cancers. However, this number does not include deaths from other smoking-related diseases. The study also highlights geographic variations, with higher percentages of smoking-related cancer deaths in certain states. Tobacco control efforts have been credited with preventing eight million premature deaths, but many parts of the country still have weak tobacco control policies. The analysis only focused on cigarettes, excluding other smoking methods and secondhand smoke. The data relies on self-reports, which may underestimate smoking prevalence. The tobacco industry still holds influence, particularly in Southern states where most tobacco is grown.

"Preliminary data released by the FBI show a 20% decrease in the number of police officers intentionally killed in the line of duty in 2015 compared to 2014. This contradicts the belief that increased criticism of police, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, has led to a ""war on cops."" However, the president of the national Fraternal Order of Police disagrees with the data and believes that officer deaths are increasing. The FBI data also reveal that instances of officers being killed in unprovoked or ambush attacks have remained steady for the past four years. The reasons for the decrease in officer deaths are unclear, but better training and policies are among the possible factors."

The Confederate battle flag, a divisive symbol, has resurfaced in the context of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign and his supporters. The flag has been displayed at Trump rallies and used as a response to anti-Trump protests. The flag's resurgence raises questions about race relations under Trump and the influence of his campaign on white resentment and white nationalism. Historians note that the flag has had shifting meanings over time, representing white resistance to integration during the Civil Rights era and now symbolizing concerns about the displacement of white culture. While some Trump supporters argue that the flag represents heritage, others acknowledge that it has been hijacked by hate groups. Reports of discrimination and hate crimes targeting minorities have increased since the election, with many incidents invoking Trump and his campaign slogans. The flag's new context is perplexing to some Southerners who view it as a symbol of Southern sacrifice rather than a political statement.

Islamic State fighters launched a series of car bomb attacks in northern Syria as U.S.-backed forces began their push to retake Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State. The operation aims to isolate Raqqa and cut off supply routes for the militants. The car bomb attacks were a preview of the fierce battle that lies ahead.

The Forced From Home exhibit organized by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) aims to teach empathy for refugees by allowing participants to experience the journey of a displaced person. The exhibit has been attended by over 17,000 people, including 3,400 students. MSF hopes to communicate the reality of the refugee crisis and generate empathy in a time when anti-refugee sentiment is on the rise. The exhibit creates an empathetic response by assigning each participant a specific displaced person's identity and sharing personal stories from aid-workers who have served in MSF camps. The exhibit challenges the notion that empathy is a globalized response, as humans are wired to empathize with those in their immediate surroundings. However, empathy can be strengthened with practice and training programs have shown promise in changing people's responses to others' suffering. While empathy alone is not a solution to the refugee crisis, it is a necessary component in finding a genuine solution.

The wealthy drip filtered and distilled water and the poor drink tap water. Those in charge don't care in the least how many Flint's there are as long as they can get their Perrier. The whole thing makes me sick to my stomach about the state of our country.	A new report by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) reveals that over 18 million Americans are supplied with drinking water that violates federal laws on lead content. The report states that the water crisis in Flint, Michigan is not an isolated incident, and that violations of national rules protecting against lead contamination are widespread. The NRDC's analysis of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows that 5,363 water systems, serving more than 18 million people, breached the federal Lead and Copper Rule in 2015. These violations include inadequate testing for lead and insufficient treatment to prevent lead from leaching into the water supply. The violations occurred in almost every state, with 1,110 community water utilities providing water that exceeded the EPA's actionable limit for lead. Despite the widespread failure of water suppliers, very few were punished by the EPA last year. Of the over 8,000 violations, enforcement action was only taken against 11% of cases, and penalties were sought for just 3% of violations. The EPA has acknowledged the challenges in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule and has intensified work with state drinking water programs. However, a revised rule will not be implemented until 2017 at the earliest. The NRDC emphasizes that unsafe drinking water is a national problem that requires a national solution. The failure of the system to detect violations is highlighted by the fact that Flint was not considered in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule last year, despite the well-known water crisis. The CDC has reported that lead levels in the blood of Flint children significantly increased after the city switched its water supply. The NRDC also revealed that water utilities often manipulate test results to downplay lead levels. The Guardian has reported that at least 33 US cities have used methods to mask the true level of lead in water tests. The report raises concerns about the extent of the issue and calls for a coordinated effort at all levels to prevent future crises.

In much of the developed world proper sanitation has proven very effective in the long term. I do find the idea of using chlorine tablets intriguing.	The text discusses the ongoing debate over the best approach to fighting cholera. On one side are public health advocates who believe that vaccines can make a significant impact in preventing and treating cholera. On the other side are public health officials who argue that vaccines are not effective enough and that the focus should be on improving water and sanitation infrastructure. The World Health Organization (WHO) has tried to support both approaches but has not settled on how to fund them. Cholera is a deadly disease caused by contaminated water, and it kills about 100,000 people worldwide each year. Two oral vaccines exist, but they have limitations and do not address the underlying causes of cholera. The debate over vaccines has caused division and hindered progress in the fight against cholera. The text also mentions the history of cholera and the breakthroughs in understanding and treating the disease. It highlights the devastating cholera outbreak in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and the missed opportunity to distribute vaccines. The text concludes by mentioning new ideas and approaches, such as using mobile phones to report cholera cases and promoting water sterilization tablets.

"Multiple studies show that Trump's sexist rhetoric can have a significant impact on thinking, stress, and self-esteem. Women have expressed feeling gross and objectified by his comments, and even trauma victims have been distressed by his behavior. Trump's defense that his words are ""just words"" or ""locker room talk"" does not render them harmless, as rude language can impair cognition and lead to less creative thinking. Uncivil political discourse, especially in a presidential debate, undermines trust in government and discourages women from running for office. Discriminatory speech has negative consequences for women, leading to anger, depression, and lower self-esteem. Different types of discrimination can compound each other, with women of color experiencing even greater harm. Trump's candidacy exposes the bleak state of gender relations in the US and raises questions about how sexism will be taken seriously in the future."

Yaffa Eliach, a Holocaust survivor and historian, passed away at the age of 81. She is known for her massive photography collection that memorializes the lives of Holocaust victims rather than focusing on their deaths. The collection, displayed in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, includes a photo of a young Yaffa Eliach taken on the day her home town was occupied by Germans. She was one of the few survivors from her town and spent years collecting photographs and documentation of every Jew who lived there. The collection became a principal exhibition at the Holocaust Museum and was installed in a tower. Eliach insisted that no photo be cropped, capturing people enjoying life before the massacre. She also wrote a book chronicling the history of her town. Eliach's work aimed to show the humanity of the victims and preserve their stories.

The Supreme Court has halted the execution of an Alabama death row inmate, Thomas D. Arthur, for the seventh time. The execution was scheduled for Thursday evening but was stayed as officials waited for the Supreme Court to consider his appeals. Justice Clarence Thomas issued an order halting the execution until further notice. The court later granted Arthur's stay request, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voting in favor as a courtesy to his colleagues. The stay will remain in place until the justices decide whether to consider the case. Arthur was sentenced to death for the 1982 killing of Troy Wicker, the husband of a woman with whom Arthur had an affair. His attorneys argued against Alabama's lethal injection protocol and suggested execution by firing squad instead. The state's Department of Corrections is only allowed to carry out executions by injection and electrocution. Alabama's death penalty system has faced increased scrutiny following a Supreme Court ruling that struck down Florida's death penalty system.

The negative connotations surrounding PTSD prevent many veterans from seeking help. Veterans want others to know that referring to them as ""weak"" is ignorant, as war experiences are incomprehensible to those who haven't lived through them. PTSD symptoms can be masked and go unnoticed, making it difficult to recognize. Many PTSD sufferers suffer in silence, fearing judgment and trying to appear strong. Contrary to popular belief, PTSD does not make individuals violent. Recovery from PTSD is possible, and veterans encourage others to seek help and know that they are not alone."

The Chicago Police Department is facing a digital archive that documents two decades of torture by its officers. The archive, called the Chicago Torture Archive, contains over 10,000 documents related to cases of torture between 1972 and 1991. These cases involved over 100 black men who were tortured by police officers to force confessions or intimidate witnesses. The archive, which will be housed at the University of Chicago, includes interrogations, trial files, journalism works, and records of activism. The launch of the archive coincides with recent efforts in Chicago to address police misconduct, including the passing of the Reparations for Burge Torture Victims ordinance. The archive's director hopes that the lessons learned from these cases can inform and inspire young activists. While the archive provides a comprehensive resource for studying the cases, there are concerns about privacy and whether victims and their families were made aware of the archive's existence. Despite these concerns, the archive is seen as an essential tool for academics, researchers, and historians to understand this dark chapter in Chicago's history. It also presents an opportunity for the police department to mend relationships with residents and increase transparency and accountability.

A suspected serial killer in Anchorage, Alaska was stopped by a police officer who was responding to a theft complaint. The officer, Arn Salao, was shot multiple times by the suspect, James Dale Ritchie, but managed to return fire and fight off his assailant. Another officer arrived at the scene and also fired at Ritchie, killing him. Ballistics tests revealed that the gun Ritchie used was the same one used in five other homicides in Anchorage in 2016. Ritchie had prior arrests for drugs and burglary and had recently returned to Alaska from West Virginia. Two of the victims linked to Ritchie's gun were identified as Jason Netter Sr. and Brianna Foisy, who were found dead in July. Another two victims, Bryant De Husson and Kevin Schuyler Turner, were found dead in August. The motive behind the killings is unknown, and it is unclear if Ritchie knew any of the victims. The police believe that the chance encounter between Officer Salao and Ritchie may have saved countless lives. Two other unsolved double homicides in Anchorage have not been linked to Ritchie.

The text tells the story of Shelton McElroy and his two brothers, who grew up in the foster care system after their mother was sentenced to prison. Shelton and one of his brothers also ended up in prison later in life. The brothers were separated and moved between foster homes, with Shelton experiencing a troubled childhood and multiple incarcerations. Despite their struggles, the brothers managed to reconnect in prison, but their relationship was strained. Shelton's older brother, William, tried to support them but eventually gave up. Shelton reflects on the interconnectedness of the foster care and penal systems in the US and the lack of support for individuals with mental health issues. He has since turned his life around, becoming a counselor and helping others who have experienced similar hardships.

Despite significant progress in global vaccination efforts, measles still claims the lives of more than 350 children daily, according to a report by UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and other health agencies. The report emphasizes that the fight against measles is hindered not by a lack of tools or knowledge, but by a lack of political will to ensure every child is immunized. While vaccination campaigns and increased routine vaccine coverage have saved millions of lives, there are still countries where a majority of children are not vaccinated. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan account for half of all unvaccinated babies and 75% of measles-related deaths. Outbreaks of measles in various countries, caused by gaps in immunization, remain a significant problem. The report highlights the need to immunize young people who have missed out on vaccinations and notes that measles tends to resurge during conflicts or humanitarian crises.

Islamic State militants in Iraq are kidnapping thousands of villagers and using them as human shields as they retreat towards Mosul. Those who refuse to comply are shot, while others are taken but manage to escape. The militants are also executing former policemen and army officers out of paranoia. This tactic of holding civilians hostage complicates the U.S.-led airstrikes and puts civilians at risk of being caught in crossfire. The militants have also set fire to oil wells and a sulfur plant, causing noxious fumes. As Iraqi forces advance towards Mosul, the militants are expected to put up a tough fight.

"A new report by environmental group Amazon Watch reveals that the United States is driving the destruction of the Amazon rainforest by importing crude oil from the region. American refineries processed over 230,000 barrels of Amazon crude oil per day last year, with California alone refining an average of 170,978 barrels per day. The expansion of oil drilling in the Amazon poses a serious threat to the region, with proposed oil and gas fields covering an area larger than Texas. The destruction of the Amazon rainforest releases greenhouse gases and puts indigenous communities and biodiversity at risk. Ecuador's state oil company recently started drilling near the biologically rich Yasuni national park. Indigenous communities are at risk of pollution, displacement, and deadly illnesses. Amazon Watch is calling for a reduction in Amazon crude imports and the establishment of ""no go zones"" in decision making."

A study suggests that legalizing the ivory trade would lead to the extinction of elephants, as the demand for ivory far exceeds what can be sustainably harvested. The researchers argue that even in the best-protected elephant populations, it is not possible to harvest enough ivory without driving the elephants to extinction. The demand for ivory in Asia results in the killing of around 27,000 elephants each year. The study emphasizes the need to focus on reducing demand for ivory in order to save elephants from extinction. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of accurately determining the amount of ivory within each country's borders to set sustainable quotas. The Kenya government recently destroyed over 100 tons of elephant ivory in an effort to combat the illegal ivory trade.

"Environmental health officers are calling for a smoking ban in playgrounds, zoos, and other areas where children play. The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health wants local councils to designate these areas as smoking exclusion zones to reduce the chances of children thinking that smoking is normal. The ban would also protect children from secondhand smoke. A recent poll showed that 89% of adults surveyed support a ban on smoking in children's play areas. Some councils have already implemented voluntary bans in certain outdoor places. Forest, a smokers' rights group, criticized the proposal, calling it ""Orwellian."" The smoking ban in enclosed public places has been in effect in the UK since 2007."

Scientists are puzzled by the uneven pattern of damage caused by the Zika virus across Latin America. While the virus has infected over 650,000 people in the region, the majority of babies born with congenital neurological damage linked to Zika have been clustered in northeastern Brazil. Health officials and scientists are investigating other factors that may be contributing to the higher toll in this region, such as the presence of other mosquito-borne viruses or environmental and genetic factors. The number of cases of birth defects linked to Zika outside of Brazil has been relatively low, leading researchers to caution that it will take years to fully understand the dangers the virus poses to babies' brains. The outbreak in Puerto Rico is being closely monitored, but the mainland United States has so far averted a major outbreak. The lack of funding for Zika research and prevention has hindered efforts to accurately count the number of people infected and assess the true impact of the virus.

The Pilcomayo River in Paraguay is experiencing an extensive die-off of caiman, fish, and other river creatures due to a combination of drought and mismanagement. Up to 98% of caimans and 80% of capybaras are suspected dead. The river has dried up for nearly 435 miles and the government has declared an environmental emergency. The mismanagement of water resources and infrastructure by both Paraguay and Argentina has exacerbated the crisis. The river's wandering behavior and the significant amount of sediment it transports downstream have contributed to the blockage and dispersal of the river outside its channel. The government is working to find a solution, but there is no water to release or divert. Zimbabwe plans to sell its wildlife, including elephants and possibly endangered African wild dogs, to replenish its coffers due to cash shortages and a drought. Critics argue that the mismanagement of the economy and lack of accountability make this plan unworkable.

However, the employees did it. It seems to me that a person, no matter the work culture, knows that fraud is fraud and what they were doing is illegal and unethical. Blame shifting doesn't paint the employees in a greater light. The company and the employees they attract both suck.	Former Wells Fargo employees have described the mental health nightmares they experienced while working at the bank. Many employees suffered from stress-induced migraines, severe anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems due to the high-pressure work environment and unethical practices. Some employees were rewarded for using unethical practices to meet unrealistic sales goals, while others were constantly observed and critiqued by managers. The experiences of these employees highlight the toll that a toxic work culture can have on mental health. Wells Fargo has acknowledged its failures and is making changes to support its employees and uphold a customer-focused culture. The extreme stress and involvement in illegal activity can worsen mental health problems. Even managers at the bank experienced severe depression and anxiety. The mental health nightmares extended to employees in the mortgage division as well, with bullying, punishment, and intimidation being common. Employees were constantly measured against each other and bonuses were sometimes blocked. The lack of compassion from supervisors during personal crises led some employees to quit. The experiences of these employees have left a lasting impact on their mental health and perception of Wells Fargo.

Donald Trump's anti-immigrant stance is based on a false notion that the country's safety is at risk from Muslim extremists due to lax vetting policies. In reality, refugees face a lengthy screening process by the United Nations before coming to the US. However, once in the country, they receive limited support in terms of job-search help and cash assistance, making it difficult for them to integrate into the American economy. This lack of support contributes to refugee families' difficulty in escaping poverty and younger generations' sense of isolation.

The police had previously refused to get involved despite pleas from the girls' families. The girls, who were sent to work in the shop at the ages of 11 and 12, were denied contact with their parents, not paid, and subjected to abuse. The case highlights the issue of child slavery in Myanmar, where at least a million children are forced to give up education and work. The authorities' handling of the case has angered the public, who see it as evidence of a biased judicial system. It was only when a journalist got involved that action was taken, leading to the arrest of the tailor and her two adult children. The president has ordered a report on how the police handled the case and is taking a closer look at the work of the human rights commission. The journalist involved is receiving a presidential award for his efforts.

Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans took to the streets in Seoul for the second consecutive weekend, demanding the resignation of President Park Geun-hye. The protests were sparked by Park's admission that she shared classified information with someone lacking security clearance. The demonstrations, which included families, students, and union members, were some of the largest anti-government protests in decades. Four officers and 26 protesters were injured during the protests. Park's spokesman stated that she realizes the seriousness of the situation and is considering ways to normalize affairs. Protesters are calling for Park's resignation due to feelings of betrayal and frustration with her leadership. The protests also stem from other incidents, such as the Sewol ferry sinking. Despite roadblocks, protesters attempted to march to the presidential palace. The demonstrations will continue until there are answers and a resolution to the political turmoil.

Cows release methane gas, a greenhouse gas, which has a much higher negative effect on the climate compared to carbon dioxide. The livestock industry, including cattle breeding and farming, is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector. Livestock pastures and feed production use a significant portion of the Earth's land surface, leading to deforestation and habitat loss. The increasing demand for meat and dairy products contributes to the overgrowth of the farming industry and its impact on global warming. Producing one kilogram of beef emits an equivalent amount of CO2 as an average European car every 250 kilometers and consumes a significant amount of energy. Consuming less meat and dairy products is an effective way to reduce one's carbon footprint and protect the environment.

This was triggered by a drop in the price of oil. I read the article i felt so sad for the people and animals that are in Venezuela. I wish there was something that i could do to help.	The economic crisis in Venezuela has led to a shortage of food, affecting both people and animals. Around 50 animals at Caricuao Zoo have starved in the last six months due to the rising cost of food caused by the economic downturn. The country's inability to import food and other necessities, along with skyrocketing inflation, has led to widespread hunger. Zoo staff have resorted to feeding carnivorous animals fruits and vegetables, and even slaughtered horses. The malnourishment of animals can have long-lasting health effects, including psychological issues. Other zoos in Venezuela are also struggling to feed their animals and are seeking donations. The situation in Venezuela is not unique, as animals in other countries, such as Gaza and Yemen, are also suffering due to poor social climates and conflicts. Animal rights organizations are working to address these issues and provide assistance to the affected animals.

The Obama administration has announced that it will resume deportations of undocumented Haitian immigrants due to a surge in Haitian migrants seeking to enter the United States. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, deportations were suspended, but they were partially resumed later on for those convicted of serious crimes or considered a threat to national security. However, since last spring, thousands of Haitian migrants who had moved to Brazil for work have been making their way to the United States. These migrants have been allowed to enter the country and given permission to stay for up to three years under a humanitarian parole provision. With the full resumption of deportations, Haitians without visas will now be put into expedited removal proceedings. The surge in Haitian migrants has overwhelmed shelters in Tijuana, and many migrants have chosen to sleep on the streets. The change in American policy has surprised advocates in San Diego and Tijuana, who object to the policy change that does not reflect any actual change in reality.

Or maybe since you know you are going to die anyway, it's better to be in a familiar area with friends and family, even though that might take years off your life...	A new study conducted in California has found that lung cancer patients exposed to air pollution may have shorter survival times. The research focused on California due to its wide range of air pollution levels and extensive air quality monitoring network. The study found that patients in areas with high levels of fine particulate matter had a median survival time of only 2.4 years, compared to 5.7 years in areas with lower pollution levels. Lung cancer patients whose cancer had spread to other parts of their bodies had shorter survival times overall, regardless of air pollution levels. The researchers suggest that newly diagnosed lung cancer patients should consider moving out of areas with high levels of air pollution. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in America, according to the CDC.

Anyway, this is bad but I imagine there's an environmental net gain, even with the eagle deaths thanks to the green energy being attained by the turbines.	Wind turbines are not only killing local birds, but also birds from hundreds of miles away, according to researchers from Purdue University and the U.S. Geological Survey. Using DNA and stable isotopes, the researchers found that golden eagles killed at a wind farm in California can come from far distances. This raises concerns about the impact of wind farms on bird populations. The Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) in California, one of the oldest and largest wind farms in the world, has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of birds. The researchers found that eagles are attracted to the area due to the abundance of prey and the windy conditions, but fail to see the turbine blades and get hit. The study also revealed that a large percentage of the birds killed are from neighboring states, highlighting the need for environmental assessments to consider the impact on the entire population. The findings have implications for the management of wind energy facilities and the conservation of bird species.

Toughie, the last Rabbs' fringe-limbed tree frog, has died, marking the extinction of his species. The frog, featured in the Photo Ark project, served as a symbol of the extinction crisis. Toughie's species was only described in 2008, three years after he was found during a frog rescue mission. The deadly chytrid fungus wiped out up to 85% of amphibians in Toughie's habitat. Photographer Joel Sartore, who photographed Toughie for the Photo Ark project, emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about extinction. He believes that people need to meet and fall in love with these animals to care about their preservation. The loss of species threatens healthy ecosystems and ultimately our own survival. Sartore warns that if we continue on this path, we could lose half of all species by the end of the century.

A study from Harvard's environmental scientist, Elsie Sunderland, predicts that the dam will expose communities to double the amount of methylmercury they currently ingest, potentially causing acute poisoning. The dam's developer, Nalcor Energy, acknowledges that methylmercury levels will spike but claims they will eventually return to pre-dam levels. However, Sunderland's study contradicts this claim. The study also highlights that other hydroelectric projects in Canada pose similar risks to indigenous populations. Indigenous leaders and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador have reached a compromise to address the methylmercury impact, but specific measures have not been determined yet.

Climate change can affect a variety of animals in many different and catastrophic ways. Melomys are an animal that may have been affected by climate change. They are now extinct and one of the reasons researchers and scientists are looking at is climate change. However there is much debate to say it was just climate change.	The Bramble Cay melomys, a reddish-brown rodent, recently made international news when it was declared extinct. While climate change played a role in its demise, human inaction was the ultimate cause. Rising sea levels due to climate change destroyed the melomys' habitat and food sources. However, it was revealed that Australian researchers had planned to start a captive breeding program for the melomys, but they were unable to find any individuals on Bramble Cay. This missed opportunity highlights the tragedy that had been unfolding for years. In a new paper, biologist John Woinarski and colleagues argue that the extinction of the melomys, along with two other Australian species, could have been prevented. The Christmas Island pipistrelle and Christmas Island forest skink also suffered from human neglect and inaction, allowing introduced predators to decimate their populations. Australia's biodiversity conservation law lacks explicit commitment to preventing human-caused extinctions, leaving species vulnerable. These extinctions are often overlooked due to the small size and remote locations of the species. Australia has the highest rate of mammal extinctions in the world, with 30 species lost since European colonization. Woinarski's assessment is driven by personal grief and a desire to learn from past mistakes. Australia still has over a thousand threatened and endangered species, and action is needed to prevent further extinctions. While climate change did contribute to the melomys' extinction, it is important to recognize the other environmental factors and the human choice to not save the species.

Between 2010 and 2014, over 60,000 wild creatures were seized, with a fifth of them being threatened species. However, wildlife advocates argue that animals often suffer after being confiscated, as they are sometimes sent to inadequate facilities, returned to traffickers, or released back into the wild where they can spread diseases. CITES guidelines state that confiscated animals should be sent back to the exporting country, a designated rescue center, or other appropriate places, with humane treatment ensured. However, this doesn't always happen due to cost, impracticality, or lack of designated rescue centers. CITES member countries have agreed to distribute a questionnaire to gather information on how nations deal with confiscated animals, and Humane Society International has offered recommendations on setting up rescue centers.

The rescued animals will now receive care and rehabilitation in their new homes. There are hopes to create new legislation in Gaza to address these issues and prevent animal smuggling.

Anyone who gives their young child an opioid is a complete idiot. Knowing the dangers of opioids now a days and that their are other alternatives, especially for young children is completely inexcusable. Any child who dies from an opioid overdose should have a the parent or guardian arrested for murder.	A recent study has found that rates of toddlers and preschoolers being hospitalized for opioid overdoses have more than doubled in recent years. The study analyzed data from over 13,000 records of children admitted to U.S. hospitals between 1997 and 2012. The increase in overdoses is possibly due to the rise in prescribed painkillers, such as OxyContin and Vicodin. Young children are often exposed to these drugs by finding pills on the floor, getting into their parents' purses, or opening bottles. The study emphasizes the need for parents to limit children's exposure to these medications and for companies to improve packaging. The study also highlights the underreported issue of young overdoses in the pediatrics community. Additionally, the study found that heroin poisonings among children increased by 161%.

"President Obama oversaw significant growth in federal spending to reduce inequality, but President-elect Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress are likely to undo these measures. Trump's proposed policies, such as building a border wall, deporting undocumented workers, and cutting taxes, could lead to financial panic and a possible recession. The repeal of Obamacare and the proposed tax cuts would disproportionately affect the poor, with millions potentially losing access to healthcare and the highest-income taxpayers benefiting the most. In order to balance the budget, the GOP would need to make significant spending cuts, which would likely impact assistance programs for the young and poor. Trump's vague plans make it unclear which specific policies would be eliminated, but House Speaker Paul Ryan's ""A Better Way"" plan provides some insight into potential cuts. Overall, Trump's presidency could make it much harder to be poor in America and represents a repudiation of Obama's economic policies."

It occurs when a person is awake and conscious but unable to move, except for their eyes. Sleep paralysis often involves nightmares or hallucinations and can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The causes of sleep paralysis are not fully understood, but stress and disruptions to sleep, such as alcohol or caffeine, can increase the risk. It can also be a symptom of other sleep disorders and mental health conditions. Kendall Jenner discussed her struggles with sleep paralysis, which may be linked to her anxiety and jet lag. Sleep paralysis is more common in people with mental health problems and young adults. For most people, it is not a chronic condition, but some individuals experience recurrent episodes. Practicing good sleep behaviors, such as avoiding alcohol and caffeine and sleeping on your side, can help prevent sleep paralysis. If it becomes a problem, a specialist may be able to prescribe medications to suppress REM sleep and alleviate symptoms.

Protesters in New Delhi took to the streets to express their anger at the government's slow response to the city's severe air pollution crisis. The toxic smoke, caused by factors such as low winds, holiday fireworks residue, and crop-burning in neighboring states, has led to the closure of schools, canceled cricket matches, and a surge in patients with breathing problems. The air quality, measured by the PM 2.5 particulate pollutant, was more than six times the acceptable level. The city's chief minister announced emergency measures, including banning construction activity, limiting diesel-generator use, and closing a coal-fired power plant. However, experts argue that more long-term solutions are needed, such as expanding public transport and permanently closing aging coal-fired plants. The burning of crop waste in neighboring states is a major contributor to the pollution, and the government is being urged to take action. Protesters, including schoolchildren, are demanding immediate action to address the pollution crisis.

A scientific study found that bonobos tend to become far-sighted as they age just like we do. They figured this out by observing them when they were grooming each other and that older bonobos positioned themselves so that there was greater distance between them and the other bonobo they were grooming.

Aging bonobos have been found to develop farsightedness, similar to humans. Instead of using glasses, they adjust their position when grooming to compensate for their deteriorating eyesight. Researchers observed that older bonobos sat back and extended their arms farther than younger bonobos, and this behavior increased over time. This shift in position is believed to be an adaptation to their declining vision. The study compared grooming distances of 14 wild bonobos between the ages of 11 and 45. The findings could provide insights into human aging and the impact of evolutionary heritage on age-related deterioration.

The healthcare system in the United States is ill-prepared to treat obese patients, with doctors often unwilling to look past their weight and provide proper care. Obese patients face difficulties ranging from inadequate equipment to biased attitudes from healthcare providers. Doctors may spend less time with obese patients, fail to refer them for diagnostic tests, and attribute symptoms to their weight without investigating other causes. The lack of appropriate medical care for obese patients extends to treatments, with drug doses often not calibrated for obese patients and surgeons refusing to perform joint replacements unless the patient loses weight. The situation is further complicated by the fear of medical professionals of being penalized for complications and poor outcomes. The article also discusses the challenges faced by doctors and therapists in providing medical care to transgender patients due to limited knowledge and bias.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man responsible for the bombings in Manhattan and on the Jersey Shore, had been planning the attacks for months and was inspired by international terrorists, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The complaint details the extent of the damage caused by the bombs, including shattered windows and victims with ball bearings and metal fragments in their bodies. It was also revealed that Rahami's father had previously expressed concerns to the authorities about his son's potential involvement in terrorism, but no further action was taken. Rahami's notebook, recovered after he was shot and wounded by the police, contained writings expressing his extremist Islamic ideology and admiration for terrorist figures. The complaint also mentions that Rahami had been acquiring materials for his weapons through eBay. The investigation is ongoing to determine if Rahami had any assistance in building the bombs.

He now faces a total of 15 federal counts of sexual exploitation of a minor to produce child pornography. The charges involve an additional child and video known to county investigators, but do not increase the number of known victims. Carraway also faces local charges in Prince George's County, where he was indicted on 270 counts of sex crimes and child pornography involving 23 children.

"This year is on track to be the warmest on record, and if carbon emissions continue to rise, record hot years will become the ""new normal"" by 2025. The damage has already been done, and the global average temperature of 2015 will be the norm by 2040. Extreme seasons will become the norm within decades if emissions continue as usual. However, there is still hope to prevent record-breaking heat at a seasonal and regional level with immediate action on carbon emissions. The Paris climate agreement's proposed emissions cuts are not enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. To keep global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius, emissions need to be slashed by an additional 25 percent by 2030. Despite concerns about President-elect Donald Trump's stance on climate change, world leaders and activists remain committed to battling climate change."

"The Trump campaign has been pursuing a strategy of publicly courting black voters while privately seeking to depress their turnout, according to a BusinessWeek article. The campaign has three major voter suppression operations targeting idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. These operations include placing negative ads on select African American radio stations and using Facebook ""dark posts"" to deliver targeted messages. The campaign believes that depressing Clinton's vote total among these groups will benefit Trump. However, there is evidence that negative campaigning does not significantly depress voter turnout. Trump's approach to African Americans has been seen as insincere, with many of his events aimed at them taking place in predominantly white areas. As a result, Trump's polling among African Americans is poor, with him trailing Clinton by a large margin. While Trump's advisors believe that he doesn't need black votes to win, future Republican candidates will, and the campaign's efforts to suppress black voter turnout may harm the party's relationship with this demographic for years to come."

The decision affects more than a million children. The smog is a result of burning crops, fireworks, dust, and vehicle emissions. The most dangerous particles, PM 2.5, reached 600 micrograms per cubic meter. Sustained exposure to this concentration is equivalent to smoking 40 cigarettes a day and increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, asthma, and pneumonia. The pollution has caused visible effects on children, including coughing and difficulty breathing. Foreigners and elites have expressed concern about winter air pollution, and some embassies discourage families with children from moving to Delhi. Parents have reported symptoms such as burning eyes and congestion in their children. The city has taken these measures for the first time, and they hope weather conditions will improve soon. Keeping children at home reduces their exposure to air pollution, but indoor air quality is often not much better unless doors and windows are closed and sealed.

Environmental groups are preparing for a fight, as these actions could have significant negative impacts on the planet. The biggest threats posed by the Trump administration include backing out of the Paris Agreement, killing the Clean Power Plan, eliminating the EPA, appointing climate change deniers to lead the EPA and Department of Energy, cutting federal spending on clean energy, avoiding regulations on methane, and opening federal lands to oil and gas drilling. However, it may be difficult for Trump to repeal and revise these regulations, and there is still hope for the planet as clean energy initiatives and pollution regulations have widespread support among the American people. Environmental organizations are prepared to fight against these policies.

Teachers at his school had expressed concerns about his well-being, but social workers found no cause for alarm. The boy's stepfather believed he was living in Mexico until the mother revealed that he had died. The boy's body was found in a closet, severely malnourished and covered in pressure sores. The mother has been charged with murder and child abuse. The family lived in a one-bedroom house, with the boy kept hidden in closets and sedated with sleep medications. The other children in the family were aware of the situation but concealed it from their stepfather. The stepfather was devastated upon learning the truth and called the police. A public memorial was held for the boy, and the stepfather vowed to continue telling his story to prevent similar cases from happening again.

Inmates at Lewisburg federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania are forced to live with violent cellmates or be placed in restraints. Inmates have no say in who they share a cell with, even if the cellmate has a violent history or severe mental illness. If they refuse a cellmate, they are placed in restraints for hours or days. Restraints are also used as punishment for inmates who break rules or get into fights. The conditions in the Special Management Unit (SMU) at Lewisburg are harsh, with inmates spending nearly 24 hours a day in small cells with little room to move. In 2014 and 2015, there were 228 in-cell fights and assaults at Lewisburg, resulting in injuries and even deaths. The use of restraints at Lewisburg has been criticized by inmates, lawyers, and auditors, but the Bureau of Prisons denies any mistreatment. Changes have been made to the SMU, but the use of restraints remains unchanged. Inmates are left with few options: accept a violent cellmate or be restrained.

A tugboat crash in British Columbia's coastal waters caused a diesel fuel leak, endangering wildlife and prompting efforts to recover the affected species. Divers found endangered abalone and juvenile herring in the fuel spill area. The outer boom meant to contain the oil broke free, spreading the oil further. Salvage crews have recovered 40% of the estimated 200,000 liters of fuel. The marine life in the Gale Passage, including a crucial herring spawning area, is at risk. The local clam fishery has been shut down, and the spill response has been criticized. Diesel is highly toxic to marine creatures. Additional protection measures are being considered.

Human Rights Watch published a report detailing accounts of sexual abuse and coercion by camp leaders, vigilante group members, policemen, and soldiers at camps in Borno State. The Inspector General of Police has set up a special team to investigate the cases. The victims, many of whom were impregnated by their abusers, had escaped captivity by Boko Haram only to become victims at the camps. The Borno State governor plans to deploy undercover detectives to the camps to bring the culprits to justice. Boko Haram is responsible for thousands of deaths and displacements in Nigeria.

Two American sisters, Robin Korkki and Anne Korkki, were found unresponsive in their resort in the Seychelles and later pronounced dead. Autopsies revealed that they died from acute pulmonary edema, or excess fluid in the lungs, with Anne also having excess fluid in the brain. The cause of the fluid buildup is still unknown, and toxicology analysis is being conducted. No visible injuries were found on the bodies. The sisters' family is seeking answers and some members have traveled to the Seychelles to gather details and bring the bodies home.

The text discusses how Donald Trump was able to give a voice to the pain and anger of millions of Americans who felt ignored and dismissed by the political elite. These individuals had been poorly educated and lacked the words to express their feelings and experiences. Trump appealed to their fears and frustrations, promising to restore their world and make America great again. The text also highlights the long-standing anger and despair that has been building for decades due to job loss and economic changes. The media and policymakers often use clinical terms to describe the struggles faced by these workers, while corporations prioritize profits over human decency. Trump's supporters accepted his controversial actions because they felt he understood their perspective.

The government has accused the Rohingya Muslim community of being behind the attacks, leading to a manhunt and reports of abuse by the military. The United Nations and the US have called for investigations into the alleged abuse and the restoration of humanitarian access. Human Rights Watch has reported burned villages and alleged rape of Muslim women by soldiers. The crisis is seen as a major test for Suu Kyi's new government, which is accused of not doing enough to address the Rohingya crisis. The Rohingya, who are essentially stateless, are considered illegal immigrants by many in the Buddhist-majority country. The security crackdown has displaced thousands of people and disrupted access to healthcare and food assistance. Suu Kyi has called for strengthening border security, following the rule of law, and creating a development plan for the area. However, the Rohingya community does not believe there is a militant group operating in the state and accuses the government of deliberate assassination. The crisis has further eroded confidence in Suu Kyi's government among the affected population.

Humans are the absolute worst thing that ever happened to this planet.	India's tiger population, which accounts for more than half of the world's total, has been rapidly declining due to human interference. While the population had been increasing in recent years, with 2,226 tigers in 2015 compared to 1,411 in 2005, this year has seen a significant increase in tiger deaths. 78 tigers have already died in the first 10 months of the year, surpassing the number of deaths in the same period over the past six years. The cause of some deaths is still being determined, but others have been attributed to human activities such as poaching, poisoning, electrocution, and road accidents. India has seized the largest number of tigers and tiger products, with 540 seizures between 2000 and 2015. The increase in tiger mortalities and seizures is a cause for concern, and experts emphasize the need for coordinated enforcement operations to combat illegal wildlife trade, which they describe as a transnational organized crime.

Native Americans from across the country have joined the protest, aiming to stop the pipeline and protect the environment. The protest continues both on-site and online.

Imagine not being able to remove your family from that situation?	The US-backed air campaign in Yemen has been accused of war crimes, with rights groups and UN officials stating that the coalition has disregarded civilian casualties and failed to distinguish between civilian and military targets. Nearly 4,000 civilians have been killed in the war, with 60% of them dying in airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition. The war has caused widespread hunger and displacement, and warplanes have targeted medical centers, schools, and infrastructure. The US provides intelligence and logistical help to Saudi Arabia, but has reduced the number of military personnel advising the coalition. The coalition claims to investigate violations, but critics argue that the backing from the US and international community has given them a free rein. The strike on a hospital in Abs exemplifies the problems with the airstrikes, as the hospital was on a list of sites not to be targeted and had markings to indicate it was a medical facility. The strike has had a significant impact, with Doctors Without Borders pulling its personnel from northern Yemen and leaving the Abs hospital closed. Experts argue that the strikes on the taxi and hospital constitute war crimes.

The UN must step up and protect these people. It seems like all they really want is to work and live in peace with their families.	Afghanistan is facing a looming humanitarian crisis as the number of displaced people continues to rise. Over a million people were already uprooted last year, and this year, at least another million Afghans are on the move within the country and across its borders. The violence and conflict in Afghanistan have forced many to flee, while others are escaping poverty and drought. The United Nations and other aid agencies are struggling to provide emergency assistance, and if they fail, it will become a full-blown crisis. The country has been plagued by massive displacement since the Soviet invasion in 1979, and the current violence is some of the worst since the Taliban was toppled. The clashes between Afghan and Taliban forces have pushed even more people from their homes. The government is unable to reach all affected areas, and the Taliban now controls more territory than at any time since 2001. The return of refugees to areas controlled by insurgents is a concern, as it could exacerbate insecurity and joblessness. The displaced are often rejected and forced into squalid camps, with limited access to clean water and food. The situation is dire, and the government is incapable of creating jobs or improving the economy in remote areas. Criminal and terrorist networks may exploit the jobless and displaced youths, further deepening the crisis.

Now, does that mean I think he's a bad politician? NO, he could possibly be effective again, but the money trail is interesting.	"Former Democratic senator Evan Bayh is facing a tough race against Republican candidate Todd Young in Indiana. Bayh has been attacked for his multiple homes, high earnings, and corporate ties. However, he still has a chance of winning, with recent polls showing a statistical tie between him and Young. Republicans are facing a cash crunch, with Bayh having a significant edge in ad spending. If Bayh wins, it would be a significant blow to GOP chances of holding their majority in the Senate. Bayh's entrance into the race was seen as a recruiting coup for the Democrats, and his bipartisan appeal has given him an advantage. Young's pitch is that Bayh has transformed from a centrist to a supporter of President Obama's agenda, using his positions to land post-Senate business. The attacks on Bayh's wealth resonate in Indiana, where the culture is parochial and politicians often emphasize their ""Hoosier"" identity. Bayh wants the race to focus on his accomplishments, such as the Evan Bayh 21st Century Scholars Program. However, the race has become increasingly negative, with outside groups playing a significant role."

The proposed lowering of the lead detection level for federal cleanup action could affect millions of subsidized and public housing units. The site has been cleaned up, but residents are concerned about the impact of planned demolition. Lead levels have also been found in nearby schools, but authorities claim they are not a risk to human health. The housing project also faces other pollution issues, including a trichloroethylene plume in the groundwater and a breach in an underground oil pipeline. Soil tests conducted by a nonprofit organization found that over 50% of the samples taken exceeded the cleanup threshold. The situation has been described as a case of environmental racism.

The dog's handler has been placed on paid administrative leave while an investigation takes place. Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in drug investigations. The sheriff described the dog's death as a ""bad accident."" The investigation is being handled by the Washington County Sheriff's Office. This incident follows a similar case in Oklahoma where a police dog died after being left in a hot car for 38 hours and its handler was charged with animal cruelty."

You need to read it, I don't know if it has anything to do with our tree's dying around our area, but I do know that between climate change and diseases introduced plants are causing some of the damage that can't be controlled."	Millions of trees across the United States are dying due to a combination of factors including disease, insects, drought, and wildfires, all exacerbated by climate change. One example is the rapid ohi'a death disease in Hawaii, which has infected nearly 50,000 acres of native forest. The cause of this disease is still unknown, and scientists are struggling to find a treatment. In California, an invasive pathogen called Sudden Oak Death is killing millions of trees, including redwoods. Bark beetles and mountain pine beetles are also wreaking havoc on forests, expanding their range due to climate change. The loss of trees has far-reaching consequences, affecting clean water, carbon storage, and entire ecosystems. Scientists are working on genetic research to understand why some trees are able to survive these threats, but they warn that in a few decades, American forests may be unrecognizable.

Its a blood stream infection that they discovered in Wisconsin that's wrecking havoc, making the majority of people it contacts sick, and killing at least a good percentage that it comes into contact with. Antibiotics are resistant!"	A deadly outbreak of bloodstream infections in Wisconsin has left health officials puzzled. The infections, caused by a species of bacteria called Elizabethkingia anophelis, have killed 15 people and sickened 33 others. The microbe is resistant to common antibiotics, making treatment difficult. The outbreak is unusual because the bacteria is typically found in hospitals, but many of the infected individuals have not had recent contact with healthcare facilities. Investigators are testing various products for contamination as a possible source. The outbreak is challenging to understand as little is known about Elizabethkingia. The bacteria is commonly found in soil and mosquitoes, and it thrives in moist biofilms. Previous outbreaks have been linked to contaminated taps in hospitals. The current outbreak is the first reported of this particular species of Elizabethkingia. Officials believe it is unlikely that the contamination comes from tap or groundwater, but the source remains unknown.

Microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by malformed heads and stunted brain development, has been linked to the Zika virus. The severity of microcephaly can vary, but it often results in mental impairment. Detecting the condition before birth is difficult, leading to debates about abortion. Raising a child with microcephaly requires extensive care and support, which can be costly. Early intervention programs can help, but they often end after three years. The CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics have published guidelines for evaluating and caring for infants with Zika-related microcephaly. The cost of care for each child is estimated to be $10 million over a lifetime. Families with resources, like the Grounds family, can provide the best care for their child, but many others struggle. Nicholas, a child with microcephaly, has made progress with intensive intervention, but ongoing support is necessary. Parents of children with microcephaly need support throughout their lives. Genetic testing revealed that Nicholas inherited two mutated genes from his parents, causing microcephaly. The odds of their second child having the condition were one in four.

"Prominent Republican women are concerned that defending Donald Trump against accusations of sexual assault is damaging the party's relationship with female voters. Trump's comments about women have been a source of concern throughout his campaign, but the release of a 2005 video and subsequent allegations by 11 women have escalated the issue. Many male Republicans have come to Trump's defense, dismissing the accusers and potentially alienating female voters. This division within the party comes as polls show that women are supporting Hillary Clinton by a significant margin. Female Republican strategists and politicians, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Carly Fiorina, have distanced themselves from Trump. The recent interview between Newt Gingrich and Megyn Kelly further highlighted the party's struggle with women voters. Republican women are increasingly feeling that the party does not represent them and are critical of the party's handling of Trump's behavior. The GOP's treatment of women is playing into the ""war on women"" narrative that Democrats have pushed in the past. Trump's personal attacks on women, both in the media and on social media, have also contributed to the party's struggle with female voters. Overall, many Republican women believe that the party is not doing enough to address the concerns of female voters and that this will have negative consequences for the party in the general election."

The shortage was caused by a leak in a pipeline that runs from Houston to New Jersey, resulting in over 300,000 gallons of gas being leaked. The states affected by the shortage include Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas. While prices have increased, they are still below $2.50 per gallon in many areas. The shortage has led to panic and frustration among drivers, with some gas stations completely running out of fuel. Efforts are being made to address the shortage, including repairs to the pipeline and alternative methods of transporting gasoline.

Many of them are facing difficult circumstances, including food and medicine shortages, as well as neglect from their families. The siege imposed by pro-government forces has made it nearly impossible to find medicine to treat chronic diseases commonly experienced by older people. Overstretched medical facilities are unable to provide proper care, leading to more deaths. Some families have even abandoned their older family members due to the extreme conditions. The situation has left many older residents feeling weak, frightened, and helpless. Despite the dangers, some refuse to leave their homes, while others are trapped and unable to leave due to the siege. The older residents of Aleppo are struggling to balance their own needs with the demands of their families, often sacrificing their own well-being. The war has taken away their dignity and left them feeling isolated and afraid.

For nearly a century, the Canadian government forcibly assimilated indigenous Canadians by taking them from their families and placing them in church-run boarding schools. These schools punished students for speaking their native languages or observing indigenous traditions, and subjected them to physical and sexual assault, medical experimentation, and sterilization. Photographer Daniella Zalcman's book, Signs of Your Identity, documents the lasting effects of this trauma through double exposure portraits of former students and related places or items. The system caused the death of at least 6,000 children, and the last Indian Residential School closed in 1996. The government issued its first apology in 2008.

Russia has claimed that the UN aid convoy that was bombed in Syria on Monday night was escorted by terrorists, denying accusations that it was behind the attack. The convoy, which was delivering food aid to opposition-held parts of Aleppo, was hit shortly after the end of a ceasefire. The Russian defense ministry released drone footage showing a pickup truck carrying militants and a heavy mortar driving alongside the convoy before it was bombed. More than a dozen people were killed, including the director of the organization. The truce collapsed as leaders were gathered at the UN in New York to negotiate a longer-term peace plan. The US accused the Syrian government and Russia of violating the ceasefire, while Moscow accused the US-led coalition of aiding ISIS. The incident highlights the deep mistrust between the superpowers and the failure to achieve a lasting agreement to end the conflict.

The drastic melt in 2016, despite stormy and cool weather conditions, has surprised experts. The ice levels fell to their lowest point this year on September 10, covering about 1.6 million square miles, almost the same as in 2007. The reduction in sea ice has significant implications for the planet's temperature, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and the Arctic ecosystem. Experts warn that if sea ice continues to decline, there may be no more sea ice within three generations. The warming oceans will result in even less sea ice each subsequent winter.

A mass grave containing the bodies of hundreds of Iraqi policemen who were executed by ISIS has been discovered near Mosul. The grave was found by Iraqi security forces during their assault on the ISIS stronghold. The bodies are believed to have been buried as recently as October, just before the US-backed forces began their assault on Mosul. The grave was visited by Human Rights Watch, who found four exposed corpses and piles of rubbish covering other bodies. Witnesses reported that ISIS rounded up around 2,000 people from the area and forced them to head towards Mosul, separating the former policemen and driving them away.

The reef is home to numerous species and is considered the world's largest living thing. Preliminary findings show that 22% of its coral has died from the bleaching event. Climate change is the main cause of coral bleaching, as it leads to the expulsion of algae from the corals. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is conducting surveys to assess the impact of the bleaching. While scientists have expressed concerns about the reef's future, it is not beyond saving. The reef supports 70,000 jobs in reef tourism, and large sections of it are still in reasonable shape. The focus should be on better protecting the reef rather than giving up on it."

"Alec Cook, a University of Wisconsin student, has been charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, strangulation, false imprisonment, and fourth-degree sexual assault. The charges are based on allegations from five women, with the earliest incident dating back to March 2015. Cook's arrest in October 2016 led to more women coming forward with potential information about him. Cook's lawyers have called for the public to wait for the facts before condemning him, criticizing the ""politically correct"" culture that leads to ""blind acceptance of mere accusations."""

Wells Fargo Bank has admitted to firing 5,300 low-paid workers over five years for opening fake accounts to meet sales targets. The bank has faced outrage and has stalled stock awards to two top executives. Wells Fargo CEO/Chairman John Stumpf admitted to finding nearly 80,000 phony accounts in Pennsylvania. The bank claims that it did not impose fees for most of these accounts. However, former employees have reported unethical practices, such as raiding customers' private data and forging credit card application signatures. Other banks, both community banks and big multinationals, have also engaged in similar practices. Wells Fargo has stated that it has scrapped its incentive system and will come up with a new plan next year.

But the way that politicians feel like they have a say over women's  bodies is disturbing.	Women are concerned about the potential threat to affordable birth control under the Trump-Pence administration. Trump and Pence have expressed intentions to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which covers birth control. In response, some women are considering getting an intrauterine device (IUD) as a long-lasting form of birth control that could outlast any changes made by the administration. IUDs are highly effective and safe, with some versions lasting up to 12 years. Women are advised to take action soon, as an IUD can cost up to $1,000 without insurance coverage. Planned Parenthood offers a guide for those interested in learning more about IUDs. The fate of the Affordable Care Act and its birth control provisions is uncertain after President Obama leaves office on January 20, 2017.

The mudslide buried towns, killed 19 people, and caused extensive damage to the environment. The cleanup efforts by the mining company responsible have been slow and ineffective, and doubts remain about the safety of the river water. The government's priority now is to reforest the river banks to prevent further contamination. Many businesses, including fishing and steelmaking, rely on the river, and fishermen who lost their livelihoods receive compensation. However, many fishermen have lost hope of ever fishing in the river again.

Crapser has spent 37 of his 41 years in the United States and has a family there. However, he is being held in an immigration detention center and will be deported as soon as the necessary arrangements are made. Crapser's life in the United States has been difficult, including being abandoned by his adoptive parents and experiencing abuse in subsequent foster homes. He has also had a criminal record, which makes him eligible for deportation. The deportation is a result of his adoptive parents and the adoption agency failing to register him for U.S. citizenship. Many intercountry adoptees face this issue, and Congress is currently considering a bill that would grant citizenship to all children adopted by U.S. citizens. Crapser hopes that the bill will pass, but it will be too late for him.

A young male wolf, part of the Huckleberry pack in Washington state, was killed by a government sniper after traveling over 700 miles in search of a mate.

The Cavendish banana, which is the most widely sold banana in the Western world, is facing the threat of extinction due to its vulnerability to diseases. The previous popular variety, Gros Michel, was wiped out by a fungal disease called Fusarium wilt. The Cavendish replaced it but is now susceptible to a disease called Black Sigatoka. Additionally, a new strain of Fusarium wilt called Tropical Race 4 (TR4) is spreading and could devastate the banana industry. To combat these diseases, scientists are studying the genetics of wild banana varieties and banana pathogens to find resistant genes. However, there has been little effort and funding for this research. By increasing genetic diversity in cultivated bananas, the industry can reduce its vulnerability to diseases. Scientists have already identified the genome sequences of bananas and the fungi causing the diseases, which provides a basis for identifying disease-resistant genes. With the use of genetic engineering and plant breeding, these genes can be transferred into desired cultivars. It is crucial to increase the pool of genetic diversity in cultivated bananas to avoid repeating the history of the Gros Michel and Cavendish varieties.

Germany, which took in more asylum seekers than the rest of Europe combined, is facing the challenge of deciding who gets to stay. Syrians and Iraqis are almost guaranteed sanctuary, while Nigerians and Pakistanis are more likely to have their claims rejected. Even Syrians are increasingly falling short of winning full refugee status. Critics argue that asylum officials are turning a deaf ear to genuine petitions from asylum seekers arriving from countries outside the Middle East war zones. The German government is increasingly targeting migrants deemed ineligible for protection and is enforcing deportation more strictly. The system is flawed, with many appeals against the Federal Office's decisions and concerns about inexperienced decision-makers and declining interpreter quality.

President-Elect Donald J. Trump's policies could have catastrophic effects on the planet's climate. By withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and terminating President Obama's Clean Power Plan, Trump could push global temperatures to rise higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius, leading to devastating consequences such as extreme weather patterns and mass extinctions. While other countries are committed to their climate commitments, Trump's actions could encourage them to abandon their commitments and emit more greenhouse gases. Trump's denial of climate change and his intention to cut off American support for UN climate science further exacerbate the situation. However, climate activists and environmental leaders are determined to continue their efforts at the local and state levels, pushing for emissions-restriction plans and the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure. Despite the divisions between Democrats and Republicans on climate policy, there is bipartisan support for investments in clean energy and climate resilience. The construction of wind and solar power plants could not only address climate change but also boost U.S. manufacturing and reduce electricity costs. The willingness of Trump and Republican leaders to support such initiatives remains uncertain.

The Democratic Party suffered a shocking defeat in the recent election, with Donald Trump winning key demographics that were expected to support Democrats. Many Obama voters flipped to Trump, and he outperformed Romney among union households, whites without a college degree, and low-income households. The success of Obama's coalition may have been due to his unique talent as a politician, rather than a stable majority. The Democratic Party is now facing a struggle for dominance between Sanders supporters and the establishment wing. With no legislative victories in sight and upcoming electoral losses, the party's future is uncertain. Economic insecurity may have contributed to the rise of racism and far-right political parties.

The infections, caused by a species of bacteria called Elizabethkingia anophelis, have killed 15 people and sickened 33 others. The microbe is resistant to common antibiotics, making treatment difficult. The outbreak is unusual because the bacteria is typically found in hospitals, but many of the infected individuals have not had recent contact with healthcare facilities. Investigators are testing various products for contamination as a possible source. The outbreak is challenging to understand as little is known about Elizabethkingia. The bacteria is commonly found in soil and mosquitoes, and it thrives in moist biofilms. Previous outbreaks have been linked to contaminated taps in hospitals. The current outbreak is the first reported of this particular species of Elizabethkingia. Officials believe it is unlikely that the contamination comes from tap or groundwater, but the source remains unknown.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) released its annual global gender gap report, revealing that the US has slipped to 45th place in terms of gender equality. This decline is attributed to a decrease in women's participation in the labor force and a shrinking number of women in senior positions. However, the US has closed its education gender gap. Globally, progress towards economic equality has slowed, with the gender pay gap persisting and women's labor force participation lower than men's. The report warns that the global economic gender gap is not expected to close until 2196. The lack of progress in economic equality is concerning, as jobs typically held by women are at risk due to technological disruption. The top-ranking countries in terms of gender equality are predominantly Scandinavian. The Global Gender Gap Index ranks countries based on the distribution of resources between men and women.

Violence has escalated between Myanmar's security forces and the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim population. Two soldiers were killed by attackers armed with guns, knives, and spears. In retaliation, the government used helicopters to fire at the attackers. The area is closed to Western journalists, making it difficult to verify the scale of the fighting. The Rohingya have been under siege since the government sent security forces to hunt for armed Rohingya assailants who had killed nine police officers. Human rights groups have received reports of killings, rapes, and beatings of Rohingya civilians. Western diplomats have called for an independent investigation into the violence, but Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has declined. The Rohingya population has been subjected to decades of repression, making them susceptible to radicalization. The government's harsh proposals may have been the catalyst for the recent attacks. The Rohingya villages have become armed camps, with reports of food scarcity, curfews, and rape by soldiers. Myanmar officials deny the occurrence of rapes.

"More survivors of the Leviathan II tragedy, in which a whale-watching boat capsized and killed six people, have filed a lawsuit against the tour operator. The lawsuit describes the terrifying moments after the boat capsized, with the ship pitching and rolling in significant waves caused by a shallow reef. The captain had stopped the boat to view sea lions when a swell rose into a larger wave, causing the vessel to heel over. One of the plaintiffs, Robert Goodfellow, was submerged beneath the sea for a considerable period of time before swimming to the surface. Another plaintiff, Marya Levin, pushed a cushion towards two other passengers who were in danger of being struck by rotating propellers. Goodfellow and Levin eventually reached a lifeboat and are now seeking damages from the tour operator for physical, mental, and emotional trauma. Other survivors have also filed lawsuits, including one detailing their attempts to escape the sinking ship and a class-action suit citing post-traumatic stress disorder. The tour operator has referred to the sinking as an ""act of god."""

"Maia Sandu, a presidential candidate in Moldova, is facing criticism for being a single woman. Former President Vladimir Voronin, who is chairman of the communist party, stated that presidential candidates should be married and campaign with their spouses. He refused to even shake Sandu's hand, calling her a ""betrayal of family values"" and a ""national disgrace."" Bishop Marchel, a leader in the Moldovan Orthodox Church, also attacked Sandu, claiming that her attitude towards Christian morality diverges from normal principles. Sandu defended herself, stating that being a single woman is not a shame. Voronin also criticized Sandu's opponent, Igor Dodon, but implied that Dodon is a preferable choice. Sandu has campaigned on a pro-European Union platform, while Dodon aligns his views with those of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The presidential election in Moldova will have a runoff vote on November 13."

Conversion therapy is a set of practices aimed at changing a person's sexuality or gender identity to fit heterosexual or cisgender norms. It is often religiously motivated and can include methods such as talk therapy, electroshock therapy, and aversion therapy. A survivor of conversion therapy, TC, shared his experience of being subjected to these practices, including harassment and physical abuse. Conversion therapy has been linked to serious harm, including increased rates of suicide and mental health issues among LGBTQ individuals. While mainstream psychiatric organizations do not support conversion therapy, it is still promoted in some circles. Only five states and the District of Columbia have laws protecting LGBTQ youth from being forced into conversion therapy. TC, who escaped conversion therapy, emphasizes the need to recognize the harm caused by these practices and to treat LGBTQ individuals with dignity and respect.

Protests erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black man was fatally shot by a police officer. Around 16 police officers were injured during clashes with protesters, who looted trucks and set fire to cargo on a highway. The shooting occurred when officers were trying to serve an arrest warrant, claiming that the man posed a deadly threat. However, the man's family disputes this, stating that he was unarmed and holding a book. The incident has reignited scrutiny of the police department, which previously faced controversy over the shooting of an unarmed black man. This shooting is the latest in a series of incidents that have sparked outrage and debate about race relations and law enforcement. The police department is currently conducting an investigation into the shooting.

The battle against the Islamic State has resulted in soldiers and civilians being injured or killed by chlorine gas, mortar fire, bombs, and artillery shells. The presence of civilians in the city has made the fight more difficult for Iraqi forces and airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition. The Islamic State has been using civilians as human shields, preventing them from leaving the city. The medical station on the outskirts of Mosul is treating injured civilians, but many are unable to reach medical assistance. The fight for Mosul is expected to be prolonged, putting more civilians at risk. The Iraqi military does not release overall casualty figures, but the toll is likely much higher than reported. The battle has also caused food shortages, forcing some residents to flee. The situation is dire, with injured children and desperate pleas for help.

A new study warns that if climate change continues, deserts in the Middle East will expand to the Mediterranean and even reach Southern Spain, transforming forests into barren lands. The study, published in the journal Science, used climate models and historical data to predict the changes in the Mediterranean if the Paris Agreement fails. Researchers found that when global warming hits 2 degrees, deserts would expand in Spain, the Near East, and North Africa. The impact of temperature changes on lands and people's lives could also affect global security. President Barack Obama has called for the development of clean energy resources to avoid conflicts and criticized climate change skeptics. He also suggested that droughts in Syria contributed to the civil war.

A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals that 90% of seabirds currently eat plastic in the ocean, and by 2050, virtually all seabirds will be consuming it. The research explains that seabirds rely on their sense of smell to hunt for food, and the scent emitted by plastic in the ocean tricks them into confusing it with food. The study also found that birds that track the scent of a sulfurous compound emitted by algae, which coats floating plastic, are six times more likely to consume plastic. The research sheds light on species that are often overlooked, such as petrels and shearwaters, which are impacted by plastic ingestion. The study highlights the need to address the growing plastic pollution in oceans, which affects not only seabirds but also sea turtles, fish, and other marine animals. The problem of plastic pollution starts on land, with nonpoint source pollution being one of the biggest contributors. The top five countries that dump plastics into oceans are China, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand.

The text describes an undercover investigation into the exploitation of Syrian refugees and children in the garment industry in Turkey. The investigation reveals that many Syrian refugees, who lack work permits, are forced to work illegally in factories for low wages. The factories often hide workers during audits and continue exploiting them once the auditors leave. Some brands are aware of the abuses and are trying to address them, but others are unaware of the conditions in their supply chain. The investigation concludes that until brands have full visibility into their supply chain, the exploitation of refugees and children is likely to persist.

"Sharbat Gula, the Afghan woman known for her striking green eyes in a National Geographic cover photo, has been arrested in Pakistan for falsifying documents and staying illegally in the country. If convicted, she could face up to 14 years in jail or deportation. Last year, Gula was arrested on similar charges but was later released. Photographer Steve McCurry, who took the iconic photo, has expressed his objection to her arrest and is committed to helping her legally and financially. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) stated that they can only assist Gula if she registers as a refugee, but she falls under the category of ""undocumented migrants."" The arrest highlights the mounting pressure on Afghan refugees in Pakistan to return home, with over 370,000 Afghans being repatriated since July 1. Human Rights Watch has raised concerns about the situation, stating that millions of Afghans have sought shelter in Pakistan due to conflict and poverty in their own country."

However, the president of the national Fraternal Order of Police disagrees with the data and believes that officer deaths are increasing. The FBI data also reveal that instances of officers being killed in unprovoked or ambush attacks have remained steady for the past four years. The reasons for the decrease in officer deaths are unclear, but better training and policies are among the possible factors."

Animal Recovery Mission, a non-profit organization, matched the existing reward fund. The Salt River Wild Horse Management Group, American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign, Humane Society of the United States, and Schill Law Firm also contributed to the reward. Despite the reward, no tips leading to the suspect's apprehension have been received. ARM Investigations, a coalition partner of the Salt River Wild Horse Management Group, decided to match the reward fund in hopes of encouraging a crucial tip. The organization fights animal cruelty and focuses on conservation programs. The witness saw a man shooting three Salt River wild horses, resulting in the death of a 6-month-old foal named Kai and injuries to two other horses. The horses are being monitored and treated by the SRWHMG. This is not the first time the wild horses of Salt River have been shot at, and the SRWHMG suspects they are being hunted. The organization is dedicated to protecting and studying the Salt River wild horses. The public can still contribute to the reward fund through a Go Fund Me page.

They gathered in Austurvollur square in Reykjavik, shouting ""Out"" to discrimination against women. The protest highlighted the 30% pay gap between men and women in Iceland. The demonstration aimed to bring attention to the issue and demand change. Despite Iceland's reputation as a gender-equal nation, progress on pay equity has been slow. The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap ranking shows that Iceland still has gaps in earned income and wages for similar work. The report also reveals that global progress towards economic parity between men and women has suffered setbacks in recent years. The gender pay gap persists due to various factors, including women entering less well-paid professions and the time it takes for employers' implicit gender biases to change. The protest in Iceland emphasizes the urgency of addressing the gender pay gap and the need for faster progress."

To me this is both sad and worrisome because people know better by now than to smoke cigarettes and this this 167,133 is just the cancers that are directly linked to smoking so the figure of deaths associated with smoking is actually much higher.	A new study reveals that 28.6% of cancer deaths in the United States are caused by smoking. The research considered 12 smoking-related cancers and found that smoking is involved in 22.9% of cancer deaths in women and 33.7% in men. In 2014, an estimated 167,133 people died from smoking-related cancers. However, this number does not include deaths from other smoking-related diseases. The study also highlights geographic variations, with higher percentages of smoking-related cancer deaths in certain states. Tobacco control efforts have been credited with preventing eight million premature deaths, but many parts of the country still have weak tobacco control policies. The analysis only focused on cigarettes, excluding other smoking methods and secondhand smoke. The data relies on self-reports, which may underestimate smoking prevalence. The tobacco industry still holds influence, particularly in Southern states where most tobacco is grown.

Consumers Reports did a huge study on vitamin brands and found that fifteen supplement ingredients can make anybody sick or even kill people. It makes me angry that companies out there are just out for the profit motive and are less concerned about how they are treating people.	Consumer Reports has released a report identifying fifteen supplement ingredients that can cause illness or even death. The risks associated with these ingredients include cancer, organ damage, and cardiac arrest. The severity of the threats depends on factors such as pre-existing conditions, the quantity of ingredients taken, and the length of exposure. The report lists the dangerous ingredients, including aconite, caffeine powder, chaparral, coltsfoot, comfrey, germander, greater celandine, green tea extract powder, Kava, lobelia, methylsynephrine, pennyroyal oil, red yeast rice, usnic acid, and Yohimbe. The report warns against the use of these ingredients due to their potential health risks. The CDC has reported that the use of dietary supplements in the United States is common, with over forty percent of the population using them from 1998 to 2004. Multivitamins and multiminerals are the most commonly used products.

"Leonard Cohen, the renowned songwriter and poet, died in his sleep after a fall in his Los Angeles home. His death was sudden and unexpected. Cohen, known for his religious imagery and themes of redemption and desire, was buried in Montreal next to his parents. He was born into a Jewish family and moved to New York in 1966 to pursue a career in music. Although he influenced many musicians and received numerous honors, Cohen rarely achieved mainstream success. His most famous song, ""Hallelujah,"" has been covered by countless artists. Cohen's work explored religion, love, politics, and the search for balance in life."

India's unregulated coal industry has resulted in serious health and environmental issues.

Elephants have caused significant property and crop damage, and deaths due to electrocution have become common. The affected communities have not received adequate compensation or support. Additionally, the generation of fly ash by power plants is causing pollution and leaching into groundwater. Lung diseases such as tuberculosis are prevalent in villages near open cast mines.

Why are we slaughtering and killing something that could be going extinct, for something as silly and unnecessary as ivory. Nobody needs Ivory to survive. It's just a want. We need to be focusing on saving the elephants and figuring out how to help the villagers as well.	At a global wildlife summit, a bid to provide the highest level of international legal protection to all African elephants was defeated. However, new measures were passed to add vital protection for elephants, including the closure of legal ivory markets within nations and tougher measures to deal with nations failing to control poached ivory. The debate over elephant poaching has divided African countries, with some arguing that making money from ivory sales and trophy hunting is necessary for protection, while others believe that poaching and the illegal ivory trade pose the greatest threat. Most African elephants already have the highest level of international legal protection, but elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Botswana have a lower level of protection. A proposal to upgrade these populations to the highest level of protection was defeated. The EU and some scientific and conservation groups opposed the upgrade, arguing that it did not meet the biological criteria. The issue of cutting the demand for ivory and better enforcement against poachers were highlighted as key solutions.

The hurricane has caused significant material damage, including the destruction of houses, crops, and trees, as well as a spike in cholera cases. The lack of urgency and support from the central government and international agencies has frustrated local officials and community organizations. The slow response has led to desperation among the affected population, with some resorting to looting. The centralization of resources in Port-au-Prince and limited aid funds have contributed to the dire situation. The priority now is to support farmers in the affected regions to recover and rebuild their livelihoods. The Lambi Fund of Haiti is working with partner organizations to clean canals, clear fields, and provide local seeds for planting.

Cliven Bundy has been illegally running his cattle on public land in Nevada for years. His cattle have become semi-feral and roam over a large area near the Nevada, Utah, Arizona border. Bundy does not vaccinate or treat his cattle for disease, does not control breeding, and rarely brands them. The cattle are now reported to be slowly starving, although there is no official confirmation. The State of Nevada has not taken action to round up the cattle due to logistical difficulties and threats from Bundy supporters. Removing the cattle will be expensive and potentially dangerous, as they are near feral and aggressive. The value of the herd will also decline in the hot Nevada summer.

A Muslim woman wearing traditional garments had her clothes set on fire by a man with a lighter while shopping on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The woman noticed her blouse was on fire and saw a man with a lighter in his hand before he walked away. The incident is being investigated as a hate crime, but no suspects have been identified or arrested. This incident follows a recent attack where a Brooklyn woman allegedly beat two Muslim mothers and tried to rip off their hijabs. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has expressed concern over the increasing attacks on Muslims and called for more resources to prevent such incidents. Another attack in August involved a Queens man shooting and killing an imam and his assistant. The suspect in that case denies the charges.

"Russia launched a major air offensive in Syria, targeting the rebel-held part of Aleppo just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with President-elect Donald Trump about their goals for ending the Syria crisis. The strikes were described as ongoing and were carried out by Russian Navy frigates and fighter jets. The Pentagon called the missile launches a ""show"" and stated that Russia already had enough firepower in Syria to cause serious damage. The Obama administration has been trying to negotiate a cease-fire in Aleppo for months, but the situation remains dire, with the city under siege and no aid allowed in since July. In addition to the military offensive, a joint report by the World Food Program and the Food and Agricultural Organization stated that food production in Syria has reached an all-time low, threatening to drive more people from their homes."

The woman, 25, reported being attacked by two U.K. men last month, but instead of being treated as a victim, she was locked up and charged. She is currently on bail but cannot leave the country and needs $30,000 for legal fees. The men have returned to Birmingham, while the woman fears a long jail term for violating the United Arab Emirates' Sharia laws on sex. Her passport has been taken, and she is staying with an English family. The incident occurred during her dream adventure after leaving her IT consultancy career. The victim's family claims that the men took turns raping her while filming the assault. In the UAE, sex outside marriage is prohibited for couples, and single individuals are forbidden from having sex with married individuals. The victim's marital status is unclear.

"A powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck central New Zealand, causing widespread devastation. At least two people were killed and many buildings and roads were damaged. The Prime Minister described the scene as ""utter devastation"" and estimated the damage bill to be in the billions of dollars. Powerlines and telecommunications were down, making it difficult to reach affected areas. A tsunami warning was issued but later downgraded. The aftershocks, including a 6.2 quake, added to the anxiety in an area still recovering from a deadly 2011 quake. The town of Kaikoura, a popular tourist spot, was heavily affected.

"The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, was known to the FBI for years but was not considered a security threat. This highlights the challenge of identifying ""lone wolf"" terrorists who are not connected to established extremist groups. The FBI retains data on individuals even after determining they are not a threat, raising concerns about privacy rights. The shooting has sparked debate about whether individuals interviewed by the FBI should be able to purchase guns or be under continued surveillance. The FBI interviewed Mateen multiple times but was unable to find any suspicious ties. The bureau is allowed to keep data on individuals even after closing investigations, which has raised concerns about privacy. Trust between local communities and the government is crucial in identifying domestic lone-wolf extremists before they commit acts of terrorism. The difficulty in identifying individuals like Mateen highlights the lack of a profile for potential terrorists."

The treatment of children in the Calais camp is not just neglectful, but abusive. The camp is in a state of hardship, with most inhabitants gone and those remaining facing constant tension and the threat of fire and bulldozers. The French authorities promised to accommodate all refugees but failed to do so, leaving many homeless. Despite detailed census information, the authorities ignored estimates and abandoned almost 2,000 refugees. Help Refugees warned that housing minors in shipping containers would expose them to danger, and now there are approximately 1,500 children subjected to these conditions. The children report lack of basic necessities such as drinking water, clean toilets, and working showers, and are only provided with one meal a day. The authorities have shown little regard for their wellbeing and have failed to safeguard them. Arbitrary security measures and restrictions on volunteers further isolate the children and cut off their access to communication and legal assistance. Many refugees are sleeping outside in the cold and rain, exposed to danger. Despite the desperate conditions, volunteers continue to provide support. Charities received notice that children in the container camp will be transferred to accommodation centers across France, but there are no guarantees and the process may take time. It is crucial for charities to ensure that refugees in France receive better care.

Toughie, the last Rabbs' fringe-limbed tree frog, has died, marking the extinction of his species. The frog, featured in the Photo Ark project, served as a symbol of the extinction crisis. Toughie's species was only described in 2008, three years after he was found during a frog rescue mission. The deadly chytrid fungus wiped out up to 85% of amphibians in Toughie's habitat. Photographer Joel Sartore, who photographed Toughie for the Photo Ark project, emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about extinction. He believes that people need to meet and fall in love with these animals to care about their preservation. The loss of species threatens healthy ecosystems and ultimately our own survival. Sartore warns that if we continue on this path, we could lose half of all species by the end of the century.

"The residents of Matheny Tract, a poor community in California's Central Valley, have been living with contaminated water for years. They have had to pay for bottled water in addition to their tainted tap water. However, legislation based on the ""human right to water"" is now being implemented, and Matheny Tract will be the first community to receive clean water under this law. Similar legislation has been introduced in Michigan, but is still stuck in committee. The issue of water inequality in rural communities has been brought to the forefront by the state's record-breaking drought. Many small rural systems in California have contaminated water, affecting an estimated 160,000 people. These communities often lack public investment and are overlooked by their local governments. The right to water is seen as a fundamental human right, and California's legislation is seen as a step towards addressing water inequality. The state has also introduced a publicly accessible database on water systems that are out of compliance. Matheny Tract is scheduled to receive clean water on June 1, marking a significant improvement for the community."

I wish there was more that we can do to help these people.	Venezuelan children are fainting and falling asleep in school due to hunger. Many students are absent because their families cannot afford to buy food. One teacher reported that a student skipped class every Thursday because it was their family's designated day to buy food at government-regulated prices. Another teacher witnessed a child faint during a cultural event because they had only eaten an arepa at 10 a.m. and it was already 3 p.m. The government spends very little on meals in public schools, and a lawmaker criticized the government for prioritizing weapons over food. A recent poll revealed that 48% of the time children do not attend school, it is due to food-related issues. Many children eat only twice a day or even just once, and for some, the school lunch is their only meal of the day. Some parents are considering changing their children from private to public schools, while others are contemplating taking their children out of school altogether. In addition to the food crisis, public schools are also facing infrastructure problems, with stolen computers and desks and a lack of funds for school supplies.

A study has found that humans have destroyed about 10 percent of Earth's wilderness since 1992, equivalent to an area half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of Alaska. The research team from Australia's University of Queensland defines wilderness as an area with no human development. The destruction is primarily due to activities such as logging, agriculture, mining, and oil and gas exploration. The study aims to raise awareness and calls for international policies to protect remaining wilderness areas. The loss of wilderness is particularly significant in South America, which has experienced a 30 percent decline. The researchers warn that once wilderness is gone, it cannot be restored, emphasizing the need to protect what is left. The report criticizes the United Nations and others for ignoring the problem and highlights the urgency of taking action to prevent further loss.

A mass grave containing bodies showing evidence of torture by the Islamic State (ISIS) was discovered near Mosul, Iraq. The exact number of bodies and cause of death is unknown, but investigators believe that many more burial sites will be found as Iraqi forces continue to retake territory from ISIS. The bodies found in this grave had been dumped on piles of trash, with some showing signs of being bound and blindfolded.

Teach for America, an organization that recruits and trains teachers for schools serving underprivileged students, is preparing for the potential end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program under the Trump administration. The organization has 146 teachers who are not documented citizens and are protected under DACA. Viridiana Carrizales, who planned for a Trump presidency, has developed a plan to help these teachers relocate and navigate immigration issues. Teach for America got involved in immigration policy in 2012 when they lobbied for the DREAM Act. When DACA became an option in 2014, Teach for America provided resources to help aspiring teachers go through the approval process. The status of these teachers is causing concern for the organization's top executive, Elisa Villanueva Beard. Teach for America teachers with DACA status also have undocumented students in their classes and discuss these issues in a private Facebook group. Carrizales, who came to the US illegally from Mexico, worries about the 146 DACAmented teachers and their families. Despite the sadness and fear among the teachers, there is a sense of resilience and determination to come through stronger.

Overpumping of groundwater in Dhaka, Bangladesh is causing a water crisis that extends beyond the city center. The pumping has caused groundwater levels to drop significantly over the past 50 years, leading to water quality and supply issues in surrounding peri-urban and rural communities. The presence of naturally occurring arsenic in shallow groundwater further exacerbates the problem. The pumping is causing faster groundwater flow, which can transport contaminants like arsenic to deeper areas of the aquifer, even outside the city limits. This poses a threat to deep wells used for arsenic mitigation in these areas. The researchers used detailed subsurface measurements to model the geology of Dhaka and found that strong pumping and heterogeneity in the underground sediments affect the hydrology of the area. Heterogeneity refers to the way sand and clay are oriented underground and is critical to how contaminants move in groundwater. In a delta system like Bangladesh, the clay layers are chopped up, allowing water to move in unpredictable ways and creating uncertainty about well contamination. The researchers theorize that if pumping continues at current levels, some wells outside the city center could become contaminated sooner than expected. The low water levels caused by pumping could also compromise the operation of handpumps in these areas. Arsenic is tasteless, odorless, and colorless, making it difficult for communities to detect its presence in water without testing. The researchers' models showed that typical hydrogeological data used to assess well safety is not predictive in this type of heterogeneous system. This highlights the need for water quality monitoring and the development of artificial groundwater recharge methods to address the water crisis in the region.

The actual driver was David Joseph Singer, who had a criminal record. Gill reported the identity theft and filed the necessary paperwork, but his license was still suspended and he lost his job as a driver for Lyft and Uber. Gill appealed the decision but faced difficulties in court due to incorrect police paperwork and testimony. Gill's friend sought help from a journalist to uncover the truth. It is unclear how Singer obtained Gill's ID information, and there are questions about why the incorrect information was not corrected. Gill's lawyer advised him not to talk to the police, but a letter from the officer who made the report could potentially clear Gill's record. The article calls for Commissioner Richard Ross to intervene and resolve the situation.

While few people have confirmed their departure, it is a topic of discussion among many. The state's economy will suffer if there is a decline in population, as it will reduce spending and tax revenue. Louisiana experienced a 6% population decrease after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, taking over five years to recover. Although this year's exodus is unlikely to be as severe, the shortage of available housing and the closure of small businesses due to the flooding pose challenges. Additionally, the decline in oil industry jobs and the state's high unemployment rate further complicate the situation. The aid and insurance money that typically accompanies natural disasters may not be enough to prevent people from leaving, exacerbating an already struggling economy.

Management and ownership at a Saskatoon dog kennel were warned about multiple serious problems with their animal care methods before the death of 14 large breed dogs. The kennel was warned about ventilation problems, among other issues, by a certified master trainer and kennel care expert. The SPCA also received a copy of the complaints but is unable to pursue them due to lack of power. The dogs died of heat exhaustion after a malfunction in the building's heating system caused the room they were in to become excessively hot. The kennel manager expressed remorse and stated that the upper-floor room where the deaths occurred has been closed off. The kennel will remain open. The kennel had previously received positive reviews from customers, but the trainer who raised concerns said that customers don't see the full picture. The trainer quit after management refused his suggestions and took his list of concerns to the SPCA.

Scientists have found that the method used by the U.S. poultry industry to stun chickens before slaughter does not consistently render them unconscious. This means that a significant number of chickens likely experience intense suffering when they are killed. The lack of regulations governing the humane slaughter of chickens in the U.S. has allowed poultry companies to prioritize meat quality over ensuring that chickens are reliably stunned. Animal protection groups are pressuring companies to phase out the use of electric water-baths and adopt alternative methods, such as controlled atmosphere killing. Gas stunning systems are considered more humane and produce better meat quality. The current process of slaughtering chickens also causes them stress and pain, with many experiencing broken bones and wing damage. The U.S. Agriculture Department estimates that hundreds of thousands of birds are unintentionally boiled alive each year. Animal welfare groups are campaigning to improve conditions for broiler chickens and some companies, like Perdue Farms, have pledged to install gas stunning systems in their facilities.

Advocates for the West has filed a lawsuit on behalf of Western Watersheds Project to challenge the Forest Service's grazing decisions in the White Clouds Wilderness and East Fork Salmon River. The Forest Service has allowed heavy grazing and repeated violations on these public lands, despite acknowledging in 2003 that grazing was causing significant harm to resources. The lawsuit aims to protect the sensitive habitat for various fish species and improve management of the watershed. The grazing has also impacted recreational opportunities in the area. The groups are urging the Forest Service to take action and prioritize the preservation of these lands.

The casualties occurred in different areas, with some victims being inside their homes when the shells landed. Both countries have not responded to the allegations of ceasefire violations. This incident comes at a time of heightened tension between the two nuclear-armed nations, following an attack on an Indian army base in September. India has relocated thousands of people from the border area, and there have been other repercussions, such as a Bollywood director refusing to hire Pakistani actors.

A new study from Umeå University in Sweden found that high rates of air pollution are linked to poorer psychiatric health in children and adolescents. The researchers examined register-based data on individuals under 18 from different regions in Sweden and found that air pollution levels do impact psychiatric diagnoses in young people. The risk of having at least one psychiatric diagnosis increased with a 10 microgram per cubic meter increase in nitrogen dioxide levels in the air. Nitrogen dioxide is a harmful air pollutant that results from road traffic and fossil fuel use. Long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide has been associated with reduced lung function, respiratory problems, and increased allergy rates.

Red squirrels in the UK have been found to carry leprosy, a disease that was eradicated in humans in Britain centuries ago. The squirrels were found to have two different species of leprosy bacterium, one of which is almost identical to a strain recovered from a medieval human skeleton. There is currently no evidence of squirrel-to-human transmission, but researchers are concerned about the health of the endangered red squirrels. The reason why squirrels, humans, and armadillos are the only known species to harbor the bacterium is still unknown. The discovery of leprosy in squirrels may help researchers understand how the disease manifests in humans and how it spreads.

The death toll in the Mediterranean Sea has reached a new record number, with over 4,600 people dead or missing this year. The central Mediterranean route, mainly departing from Libya, has seen the highest number of deaths. The issue is not the lack of resources in rescue operations, but the instability and violence in Libya, where human traffickers exploit people's hopes for a better life. The Libyan Civil War worsened the situation, leaving vulnerable migrants in a dangerous position. Traffickers are increasingly unconcerned with safety, forcing migrants to make the journey in rough seas without proper equipment. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) advocates for long-term policies that provide information about the dangers of the journey and safe passages for migrants. The IOM is also fighting against a negative narrative on migration, highlighting its historical positive impact.

The previous official death toll was only 19 deaths in Indonesia. The fires, set to clear land for palm oil and pulpwood plantations, occur mainly on Sumatra and Borneo, with the haze blowing over Singapore and Malaysia. The study combined satellite data with health impact models and pollution readings to estimate that 91,600 deaths occurred in Indonesia, 6,500 in Malaysia, and 2,200 in Singapore. The study only looked at health impacts on adults and the effect of fine-particulate matter, not the impact on children or other toxins produced by the fires. Last year's fires were among the worst in memory, causing widespread illness and diplomatic tensions. In other news, Samoa experienced a rare hail storm, causing disbelief among residents who thought it was a hoax. This was only the second time hail has fallen in Samoa since records began. The storm lasted 10 to 15 minutes and produced small hail stones with no reported damage. Finally, Typhoon Meranti, the strongest typhoon to hit China this year, has left 28 people dead and 15 missing in the east of the country. The typhoon caused significant damage to houses and resulted in economic losses of over $2.5 billion.

Iraqi Christians who were brutalized by the Islamic State and betrayed by their neighbors doubt they will ever be able to return to Mosul. The advance of the Islamic State scattered religious and ethnic minorities in the area, and the future of the region will be defined by who decides to return. While some villagers express hope in rebuilding and staying, others believe the area is lost and will only get worse. Iraq's news media has been showing images of soldiers recapturing desecrated churches, implying that it will soon be safe for Christians to return. However, Christians have been leaving Iraq for years, and community leaders say it will be difficult to go back to Mosul due to the pain and threats they experienced. Many Christians who do return would likely only do so to sell their houses and leave.

To me, that means the bike lanes never should have been put in in the first place, and they are a non-issue now. A city government needs to prioritize, and that small a percentage of the population unfortunately doesn't get much in the way of money.	The debate in South Africa revolves around whether bike lanes are racist and classist. The lack of bike lanes in Johannesburg has led to dangerous conditions for cyclists, with many fatalities. The new mayor, Herman Mashaba, halted the construction of new bike lanes due to the cost and prioritization of basic services for the poor. Opponents argue that bike lanes symbolize a city that is not designed for everyone, while proponents see them as a way to address historical inequalities and create a more livable city. However, the implementation of bike lanes has been problematic, with misuse by taxis and cars parking in them. The issue became a political target, with bike lanes being criticized as a symbol of decadence and out-of-touch thinking. Despite the controversy, some cyclists, like Dan Khumalo, appreciate the presence of bike lanes as it makes their commutes safer.

The article highlights the side effects of various birth control options for women, which are equally as bad but have not been halted. Women have always borne the burden of birth control, and the article argues that men should share in the responsibility. The availability of birth control has been revolutionary for women, leading to wage gains, increased college enrollment, and a decline in teen pregnancies. The article points out the double standard in the standards for male and female birth control, with women being expected to endure more side effects.

The mental health care provided to detainees at Guantánamo Bay has been compromised by a lack of training, ethical boundaries, and information about their treatment during interrogations. Psychiatrists and psychologists were often unaware of the abuse that had taken place, and were discouraged from asking detainees about their experiences. The quality of care has been criticized by human rights groups and defense teams, who argue that it has been negligent and ineffective. Many detainees suffer from psychological problems as a result of their treatment, but PTSD is rarely diagnosed due to the impracticality of treatment in the prison environment. The mental health personnel faced numerous challenges, including distrust from detainees and the blurred lines between medical care and interrogation. Despite these obstacles, they did their best to provide care to the prisoners.

How about trying to eat something prepackaged a little past its date? We were in this position in my family, but it is NOT an issue any longer. We have a well oiled machine regarding the food we consume.	A study published in Plos One reveals that Americans waste a significant amount of food, with about 133 billion pounds of edible food going uneaten in 2010. Two-thirds of this waste is attributed to consumers. The paper highlights the negative environmental impact of food waste, as 95% of it ends up in landfills. Ohio State University professor Brian Roe suggests that increasing awareness of the issue can lead to purposeful action to reduce food waste. A national survey conducted last year found that 53% of Americans are aware of the problem, a 10% increase from a previous study. The survey also revealed that many people believe throwing away food after the package date reduces the risk of food-related illnesses and that some food waste is necessary for freshness. Additionally, 77% of respondents feel guilty about wasting food, while 58% understand the environmental consequences. However, 51% believe it is difficult to reduce home food waste, and 42% claim to lack the time to address the issue.

Let's fix this mess!	A new study in Science reveals that global warming has already affected every aspect of life on Earth, from genes to entire ecosystems. With just a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, major impacts are already being felt in natural systems. More than 80% of ecological processes that support healthy marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems show signs of responses to climate change. These impacts have consequences for humans, including increased pests and disease outbreaks, unpredictable changes in fisheries, and decreasing agriculture yields. Understanding the adaptive capacity in nature can help address these issues and apply the same principles to crops, livestock, and aquacultural species. The study emphasizes the need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as there are already significant and widespread impacts from climate change across biological systems.

Members of the band Eagles of Death Metal, who were playing at the Bataclan concert hall during the Paris Attacks, attended a memorial in Paris to honor the 130 people killed in the coordinated terrorist attacks. The band's frontman, Jesse Hughes, praised the city's response to the tragedy. Sting performed the first show at the Bataclan since the attacks, but Hughes was not allowed to enter due to his previous comments about Muslim security personnel collaborating with the attackers. Hughes later apologized for his statement. At the memorial, Hughes expressed his gratitude to the people of France. Sting's performance included a moment of silence and a statement in French to remember the victims and celebrate the venue's history.

A recent article in the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta has sparked a national debate in Russia about the role of social media in promoting suicide among young people. The article claims that Russia's most popular social network, VKontakte (VK), has numerous groups that encourage vulnerable young people to kill themselves. The article alleges that at least 80 recent suicides can be linked to these online groups. Critics have accused the article of sensationalism and placing too much emphasis on the internet as a cause of juvenile suicide. However, the article has also prompted law enforcement agencies to launch a criminal case over groups on VK that allegedly promote suicide. Russia has one of the highest rates of youth suicide in the world, and the article has brought much-needed attention to this serious issue.

"With two weeks to go, Donald Trump's chances of winning the election are almost closed. Hillary Clinton is ahead in states worth more than 270 electoral votes. The focus now is on how many down-ballot Republicans Trump will drag down with him. Republican operatives and conservative radio hosts have declared that Trump is done and there is little he can do to turn it around. Trump's deficits in national and swing state polls are unprecedented, and his ground game is weak compared to Clinton's. Early voting numbers in Arizona and the shrinking advantage of Republicans in Florida and North Carolina indicate a potential win for Clinton. However, Democrats are not taking the outcome for granted and are working hard to mobilize voters. Trump's refusal to accept the voting results and his controversial remarks have galvanized Clinton's supporters. Trump's blaming of a globalist conspiracy and claims of a rigged election have raised concerns about the integrity of the election system. Trump's downward spiral has also affected House Republicans and vulnerable Senate candidates. Overall, Republicans are scared and the race has become a ""horror show"" for them."

The British Government is supporting an oil drilling project in Uganda's Murchison Falls National Park, which poses a significant risk to the endangered Rothschild giraffe species. The project involves drilling multiple wells in the park, which is home to one of the last remaining populations of these giraffes. Leaked documents reveal that the British oil company, Tullow Oil, has been in talks with the government to provide taxpayer-backed loans and insurance for the project. Conservationists have been relocating giraffes away from the drilling sites to protect them.

I must say that it sure seems that California in particular has been experiencing alot of fires over the last few years. Hopefully we start to get a better handle on climate change, as well as more effective ways of dealing with fires that do occur.	A new study reveals that human-induced climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires in the western United States over the past 30 years. The study shows that heightened temperatures and increased aridity since 1984 have caused fires to spread across an additional 16,000 square miles, an area larger than Massachusetts and Connecticut combined. The authors warn that further warming will exponentially increase fire activity in the coming decades. The study also highlights the role of climate change in exacerbating the recent California drought and the rise in fire incidents. Factors such as a natural climate oscillation and firefighting practices have also contributed to the increase in fires. The researchers emphasize the need to prepare for larger fire years due to climate change.

Crapser has spent 37 of his 41 years in the United States and has a family there. However, he is being held in an immigration detention center and will be deported as soon as the necessary arrangements are made. Crapser's life in the United States has been difficult, including being abandoned by his adoptive parents and experiencing abuse in subsequent foster homes. He has also had a criminal record, which makes him eligible for deportation. The deportation is a result of his adoptive parents and the adoption agency failing to register him for U.S. citizenship. Many intercountry adoptees face this issue, and Congress is currently considering a bill that would grant citizenship to all children adopted by U.S. citizens. Crapser hopes that the bill will pass, but it will be too late for him. The Adoptee Rights Campaign and others find his deportation appalling and are urging the community to call members of Congress to support a legislative fix.

I never thought of how what I do in my garden could have such a affect on other animals and other people's ponds and gardens.	A study suggests that garden ponds are contributing to the spread of deadly frog diseases in the UK. Ranaviruses, which can infect amphibians, reptiles, and fish, have devastated common frog populations. The research indicates that infected animals from aquatic retailers or the movement of species between ponds may be worsening the problem. The virus appears to be spreading faster than frogs can hop, and human-aided dispersal is likely involved. Ranaviruses are a group of viruses found worldwide, and they can kill common frogs by causing sores and blisters on their skin or internal bleeding. Genetic records suggest that ranavirus was introduced to the UK on two separate occasions. Garden ponds can act as stepping stones for infected animals to reach new sites, and the transfer of frogspawn or frogs between ponds may be aiding the spread of the virus. The study emphasizes the need to manage the risk of disease outbreaks while still supporting wildlife by adding ponds to urban gardens. Limiting the movement of potentially-infectious material is strongly advised.

However, experts argue that these measures are not enough to save the species. The current plan neglects local livelihoods, fails to involve local fishermen in designing a sustainable management plan, and does not adequately address the totoaba trade. The ban on gill nets is seen as a step forward, but more interventions are needed to ensure the vaquita's recovery. This case highlights the challenges and complexities of endangered species conservation. Conservation efforts often come too late or lack the thoroughness needed to make a lasting impact. A long-term vision and proactive action are necessary to effectively conserve species and natural resources.

A young male wolf, part of the Huckleberry pack in Washington state, was killed by a government sniper after traveling over 700 miles in search of a mate. The wolf had been saved from extermination as a pup in 2014. He was collared in February and survived the wolf-killing fields in Idaho before being shot near Wildlife Services in Montana. The Center for Biological Diversity, along with lawyers, scientists, and activists, are fighting for the protection of wolves in states where they often face cruel deaths.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended his surprise ban on most currency in circulation in India, which has caused chaos and inconvenience for millions of people. Modi argued that the ban was necessary to fight corruption and reduce the use of unaccounted-for cash in the country. However, opposition leaders and many citizens have criticized the move, as people have faced long lines at banks and ATMs, and many machines have run out of cash. Despite the hardships, some individuals expressed support for the ban, believing that it will ultimately benefit the nation. The transition to new currency notes has been complicated by the fact that many ATMs are not working and cannot dispense the new notes. The Finance Ministry reported that Indians have deposited about $45 billion in banned currency notes since the policy began, while banks and ATMs have given out $7.5 billion in new currency notes. The ban has had a significant impact on businesses, with sales falling and customers unable to pay with cash. While some individuals believe the ban is necessary, others argue that it is causing unnecessary suffering for the poor and that the real black money is hidden in Swiss bank accounts.

"Prominent Republican women are concerned that defending Donald Trump against accusations of sexual assault is damaging the party's relationship with female voters. Trump's comments about women have been a source of concern throughout his campaign, but the release of a 2005 video and subsequent allegations by 11 women have escalated the issue. Many male Republicans have come to Trump's defense, dismissing the accusers and potentially alienating female voters. This division within the party comes as polls show that women are supporting Hillary Clinton by a significant margin. Female Republican strategists and politicians, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Carly Fiorina, have distanced themselves from Trump. The recent interview between Newt Gingrich and Megyn Kelly further highlighted the party's struggle with women voters. Republican women are increasingly feeling that the party does not represent them and are critical of the party's handling of Trump's behavior. The GOP's treatment of women is playing into the ""war on women"" narrative that Democrats have pushed in the past. Trump's personal attacks on women, both in the media and on social media, have also contributed to the party's struggle with female voters. Overall, many Republican women believe that the party is not doing enough to address the concerns of female voters and that this will have negative consequences for the party in the general election."

The lack of rain and snow has caused reservoirs to reach record lows, rivers to dwindle, and lakes to disappear. The drought has had devastating effects on the Native American tribes in Nevada, such as the Yomba Reservation, where ranchers have been forced to sell off their herds.

The Chicago Police Department is facing a digital archive that documents two decades of torture by its officers. The archive, called the Chicago Torture Archive, contains over 10,000 documents related to cases of torture between 1972 and 1991. These cases involved over 100 black men who were tortured by police officers to force confessions or intimidate witnesses. The archive, which will be housed at the University of Chicago, includes interrogations, trial files, journalism works, and records of activism. The launch of the archive coincides with recent efforts in Chicago to address police misconduct, including the passing of the Reparations for Burge Torture Victims ordinance. The archive's director hopes that the lessons learned from these cases can inform and inspire young activists. While the archive provides a comprehensive resource for studying the cases, there are concerns about privacy and whether victims and their families were made aware of the archive's existence. Despite these concerns, the archive is seen as an essential tool for academics, researchers, and historians to understand this dark chapter in Chicago's history. It also presents an opportunity for the police department to mend relationships with residents and increase transparency and accountability.

"In South Africa, private security companies are training anti-poaching guards to protect rhinos from poachers. The demand for rhino horns, which are used in traditional medicine and high-end ornaments, has led to a spike in poaching.

The security industry plays a crucial role in protecting rhinos on private game reserves, but there are concerns about the escalating conflict and the potential for violence.

"Protests against President-elect Donald Trump continued in Portland, Oregon, where one person was shot during a confrontation with a protester. The shooter fled the scene. The protests in Portland followed a night of rowdy demonstrations, with police using tear gas to disperse the crowd. Similar protests have taken place across the country, including in Los Angeles, where 200 people were arrested, and in New York, where a ""love rally"" was held. Protests also occurred in Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, and other cities. International demonstrations were held in Berlin, Germany. The protests have been largely peaceful, but there have been instances of vandalism and violence."

"Yahoo announced that personal data from at least 500 million user accounts was stolen by a ""state-sponsored actor."" The stolen data includes names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords, and encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The hacker did not obtain data about users' credit cards or bank accounts. The breach occurred in late 2014, but it is unclear when Yahoo first became aware of it. The hacker first offered to sell the data last month. Yahoo believes the hacker is no longer in their network and did not name the country involved. In 2012, Yahoo had over 1 billion user accounts. The breach comes two months after Yahoo announced the sale of its core internet business to Verizon for $4.8 billion. Verizon learned of the breach recently but has few details at this time."

Arctic sea ice levels have reached their second lowest level ever recorded, according to scientists. The drastic melt in 2016, despite stormy and cool weather conditions, has surprised experts. The ice levels fell to their lowest point this year on September 10, covering about 1.6 million square miles, almost the same as in 2007. The reduction in sea ice has significant implications for the planet's temperature, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and the Arctic ecosystem. Experts warn that if sea ice continues to decline, there may be no more sea ice within three generations. The warming oceans will result in even less sea ice each subsequent winter. The annual refreezing process has already begun, but experts predict further dramatic losses in the coming years.

Thousands of residents have fled the eastern neighborhoods of Mosul, the city held by the Islamic State, in the first significant wave of people escaping since the offensive to retake the city began two weeks ago. Over 1.2 million people are still believed to be trapped in Mosul, while newly constructed camps in the area can only accommodate 60,000 people. The fleeing residents, including shepherds with their herds of sheep, are heading towards a camp for displaced people on the banks of the Khazir River. Some of those who escaped were visibly relieved, removing their black veils and waving V for victory as Iraqi and Kurdish troops passed by. The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, released an audio recording calling on his followers to remain steadfast and fight. Iraqi commanders believe it is only a matter of time before the city is recaptured, but the fate of the civilians trapped inside remains uncertain. The number of civilians fleeing has significantly increased as fighting moves into more densely populated neighborhoods. Iraqi forces are trying to keep families in their homes as much as possible to avoid a humanitarian crisis, but many people are choosing to flee as conflict approaches. The Iraqi forces are also searching houses for Islamic State fighters trying to hide among civilians.

The treatment of children in the Calais camp is not just neglectful, but abusive. The camp is in a state of hardship, with most inhabitants gone and those remaining facing constant tension and the threat of fire and bulldozers. The French authorities promised to accommodate all refugees but failed to do so, leaving many homeless. Despite detailed census information, the authorities ignored estimates and abandoned almost 2,000 refugees. Help Refugees warned that housing minors in shipping containers would expose them to danger, and now there are approximately 1,500 children subjected to these conditions. The children report lack of basic necessities such as drinking water, clean toilets, and working showers, and are only provided with one meal a day. The authorities have shown little regard for their wellbeing and have failed to safeguard them. Arbitrary security measures and restrictions on volunteers further isolate the children and cut off their access to communication and legal assistance. Many refugees are sleeping outside in the cold and rain, exposed to danger. Despite the desperate conditions, volunteers continue to provide support. Charities received notice that children in the container camp will be transferred to accommodation centers across France, but there are no guarantees and the process may take time. It is crucial for charities to ensure that refugees in France receive better care.

At least 800,000 people urgently need food, but there is not enough aid reaching the affected areas. Truckloads of food and medical supplies have been looted, and desperate crowds have clashed with police. The storm destroyed homes, crops, and livestock, leaving many without shelter or a means to survive. Cholera outbreaks are also occurring due to contaminated water supplies. The United Nations has only raised one-third of the emergency funding needed to help the affected population. The Haitian government, along with international relief organizations, is coordinating efforts to provide assistance, but political obstacles and the upcoming elections pose challenges. The situation is dire, with people sleeping under trees and lacking basic necessities. The destruction is so severe that some remote mountain villages may not receive aid until the end of November.

Russia has claimed that the UN aid convoy that was bombed in Syria on Monday night was escorted by terrorists, denying accusations that it was behind the attack. The convoy, which was delivering food aid to opposition-held parts of Aleppo, was hit shortly after the end of a ceasefire. The Russian defense ministry released drone footage showing a pickup truck carrying militants and a heavy mortar driving alongside the convoy before it was bombed. More than a dozen people were killed, including the director of the organization. The truce collapsed as leaders were gathered at the UN in New York to negotiate a longer-term peace plan. The US accused the Syrian government and Russia of violating the ceasefire, while Moscow accused the US-led coalition of aiding ISIS.

The Pilcomayo River in Paraguay is experiencing an extensive die-off of caiman, fish, and other river creatures due to a combination of drought and mismanagement. Up to 98% of caimans and 80% of capybaras are suspected dead. The river has dried up for nearly 435 miles and the government has declared an environmental emergency. The mismanagement of water resources and infrastructure by both Paraguay and Argentina has exacerbated the crisis. The river's wandering behavior and the significant amount of sediment it transports downstream have contributed to the blockage and dispersal of the river outside its channel. The government is working to find a solution, but there is no water to release or divert. Zimbabwe plans to sell its wildlife, including elephants and possibly endangered African wild dogs, to replenish its coffers due to cash shortages and a drought. Critics argue that the mismanagement of the economy and lack of accountability make this plan unworkable.

The text tells the story of Shelton McElroy and his two brothers, who grew up in the foster care system after their mother was sentenced to prison. Shelton and one of his brothers also ended up in prison later in life. The brothers were separated and moved between foster homes, with Shelton experiencing a troubled childhood and multiple incarcerations. Despite their struggles, the brothers managed to reconnect in prison, but their relationship was strained. Shelton's older brother, William, tried to support them but eventually gave up. Shelton reflects on the interconnectedness of the foster care and penal systems in the US and the lack of support for individuals with mental health issues. He has since turned his life around, becoming a counselor and helping others who have experienced similar hardships.

A mass grave containing the bodies of hundreds of Iraqi policemen who were executed by ISIS has been discovered near Mosul. The grave was found by Iraqi security forces during their assault on the ISIS stronghold. The bodies are believed to have been buried as recently as October, just before the US-backed forces began their assault on Mosul. The grave was visited by Human Rights Watch, who found four exposed corpses and piles of rubbish covering other bodies. Witnesses reported that ISIS rounded up around 2,000 people from the area and forced them to head towards Mosul, separating the former policemen and driving them away. Gunfire and screams were heard on multiple occasions, indicating further executions. Human Rights Watch has called for ISIS to be held accountable for these crimes against humanity.

Climate change has had a broad impact on ecosystems, with evidence of its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. A study identified 94 core ecological processes, of which 82% showed evidence of impact from climate change. These impacts range from shifts in species ranges and changes in phenology to disruptions at the genetic and ecosystem levels. Species are adapting to temperature extremes, with changes in physiology and morphology. Changes in phenology, abundance, and distribution of species have also been observed. These impacts have implications for food security, as reduced genetic diversity, inconsistent crop yields, and decreased productivity in fisheries threaten resources. Changes in disease vectors and the emergence of novel pathogens and pests pose a direct threat to human health and resources. Understanding these impacts is crucial for adapting to and mitigating the influence of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

The Kenyan government plans to close the camp by November 30th and has accepted a request to extend the deadline by six months. However, the IRC warns that deferring the closure will not address the refugees' concerns about violence, displacement, and gender-based violence in Somalia. The IRC emphasizes the need for support and integration programs for refugees, as well as investment in Somalia to provide earning opportunities. Since the announcement of the camp's closure, the rate of refugee movement from Kenya to Somalia has increased four-fold.

Two divers, Patrick Peacock and Chris Rittenmeyer, were found dead in the Eagle's Nest cave dive area in Western Florida. They had gone diving with a third man who reported them missing. The bodies were found the next day in a dangerous area of the cave system. The cave is known for its allure and is a popular destination for experienced divers. However, it is also considered dangerous, and signs warn divers of the risks. The area had been off-limits for divers from 1999 to 2003. Only highly trained divers should attempt to dive there, as even skilled divers can be affected at dangerous depths. The cause of death has not been disclosed, and autopsy results are pending. Some people have called for the area to be closed again, while others argue that people should be allowed to dive there if they have the necessary training and experience. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission did not comment on whether the site might be closed.

An investigation by Human Rights Watch has concluded that the deadly attack on a school in Syria was carried out by Syrian regime and Russian warplanes. Russia initially denied that any airstrikes had taken place, but satellite imagery and drone footage released by the Russian Ministry of Defence showed damage consistent with HRW's evidence. HRW has compiled video evidence and witness testimonies, and called on Russia to conduct a thorough investigation. This attack is one of many targeting civilian infrastructure in Syria, with over 4,200 schools damaged or destroyed during the six-year war. Efforts are being made to establish culpability for war crimes committed in Syria through the UN General Assembly and national courts in Europe and the United States.

The government and international health agencies should be well equipped to handle this kind of situation. Also the war has destroyed the government capabilities of providing urgent care for people in need.	The number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen has risen to 1,410 within three weeks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The outbreak was declared on October 6, and by October 10, there were 24 suspected cases. However, as of Thursday, there were 1,410 suspected cases in 10 out of Yemen's 23 governorates. The conflict between a Saudi Arabia-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi group has destroyed much of Yemen's infrastructure, making it difficult to control the disease outbreak. Cholera is just one of the risks in Yemen's war, which has left millions displaced and in need of medical help. Only 47 of the suspected cases have tested positive for cholera, and the outbreak has spread beyond the capital to nine other governorates. Children under 10 account for half of the cases, with six deaths from cholera and 36 associated deaths from acute watery diarrhea. Prompt treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics is crucial in severe cases.

The study, which is the first to quantify the sea ice changes in each polar bear subpopulation, shows a trend towards earlier sea ice melt in the spring and later ice growth in the fall. These changes negatively impact the feeding and breeding capabilities of the bears, as they rely on the sea ice for essential activities such as hunting and traveling. The study also found that the critical timing of the sea ice break-up and freeze-up is changing in all areas, which is harmful for polar bears. The researchers recommend that the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance be incorporated as measures of climate change in future reports.

The research explains that seabirds rely on their sense of smell to hunt for food, and the scent emitted by plastic in the ocean tricks them into confusing it with food. The study also found that birds that track the scent of a sulfurous compound emitted by algae, which coats floating plastic, are six times more likely to consume plastic. The research sheds light on species that are often overlooked, such as petrels and shearwaters, which are impacted by plastic ingestion. The study highlights the need to address the growing plastic pollution in oceans, which affects not only seabirds but also sea turtles, fish, and other marine animals. The problem of plastic pollution starts on land, with nonpoint source pollution being one of the biggest contributors. The top five countries that dump plastics into oceans are China, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand.

The study, which tracked one million Danish women for 13 years, found that women taking the combined oral contraceptive were 23% more likely to be diagnosed with depression, while those using progestin-only pills were 34% more likely. Teens were at the greatest risk, with an 80% increase in depression when taking the combined pill. Other hormone-based methods, such as the hormonal IUS/coil, the patch, and the ring, were shown to increase depression at a higher rate than oral contraceptives. The study suggests that the practice of encouraging teens to use these alternatives to the pill is misguided. The medical community's response to the study has been dismissive, with experts downplaying the link and offering paternalistic advice. The burden of avoiding unwanted pregnancy falls on women, despite the potential negative effects on their health and wellbeing. Effective alternatives to hormonal contraceptives exist, but they are often overlooked. It is important to remember that women are twice as likely to experience depression as men, and blaming women's depression on their biological femaleness is acceptable, but blaming medication formulated from synthetic hormones is not. The study's authors plan to research the possible association between hormonal birth control and suicide attempts or completions. While not every woman experiences depression and anxiety from hormonal contraceptives, it is important to acknowledge that many do, and their lives could be improved by recognizing and addressing this issue.

Gay men are unable to donate blood to victims of the Orlando shooting due to a year-long celibacy requirement imposed by the FDA. These regulations were implemented in 2015, supposedly ending the ban on gay men's blood, but still prevent even monogamous gay men from donating. The ban originated in 1983 during the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but the American Medical Association has called for its end, stating it is discriminatory and lacks scientific basis. Misinformation spread on social media falsely claimed the ban had been lifted in Orlando. The ban is seen as unjustified, and other countries, like Argentina, have already abolished it. The Council on American-Islamic Relations is helping to maintain blood supplies. The article calls for the end of this oppressive policy and highlights the need for continued resistance in the face of tragedy.

The United Nations has expressed concern over the sharp increase in civilian casualties in Yemen since peace talks collapsed last month. The majority of these casualties were caused by airstrikes from a coalition led by Saudi Arabia. At least 329 civilians have been killed and 426 injured since the beginning of August. Saudi Arabia and its allies are trying to prevent an international investigation into possible war crimes. The United States and Britain, major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia, are finding it harder to ignore the bloodshed. The most recent example of the carnage was an airstrike on a market and residential area in Hodeidah, which killed at least 26 civilians. The United Nations has documented numerous attacks on civilian facilities by both coalition and rebel forces. Doctors Without Borders has pulled staff members out of six hospitals in Yemen after coalition planes bombed a facility. The United Nations has also expressed concern over the blockade of the city of Taiz, which has left residents critically short of food and water. The majority of civilian casualties have been caused by the Saudi-led coalition, according to a report to the Human Rights Council. Saudi Arabia and President Hadi's government have condemned the report as biased and have proposed a Yemeni commission to investigate human rights violations. Rights groups argue that a national body lacks expertise and that its reporting falls short of international standards. The European Union has drafted a competing resolution calling for a United Nations mission to Yemen. The Council will decide how to proceed after a week of diplomatic negotiations. President Hadi accused Iran of blocking the path towards peace in Yemen.

Women are concerned about the potential threat to affordable birth control under the Trump-Pence administration. Trump and Pence have expressed intentions to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which covers birth control. In response, some women are considering getting an intrauterine device (IUD) as a long-lasting form of birth control that could outlast any changes made by the administration. IUDs are highly effective and safe, with some versions lasting up to 12 years. Women are advised to take action soon, as an IUD can cost up to $1,000 without insurance coverage. Planned Parenthood offers a guide for those interested in learning more about IUDs. The fate of the Affordable Care Act and its birth control provisions is uncertain after President Obama leaves office on January 20, 2017.

A new study suggesting that Earth could be doomed to warming of up to 13 degrees Fahrenheit is being dismissed as flawed by climate scientists. The study, published in Nature, offers a reconstruction of global sea-surface temperatures for the past two million years. However, several top scientists argue that the author's conclusions about catastrophic temperature rise are not supported by the data. They claim that the study's author made a fundamental mistake in her analysis. Other scientists also criticize the study for extrapolating from past ice ages to the present climate. NASA's chief climate scientist states that if greenhouse gas levels stay the same, temperatures may rise an additional 0.5 to 1 degree Celsius, not 7 degrees. The study's author defends her work, stating that it shows a close relationship between temperature and greenhouse gases. However, critics argue that her method is not the way to determine the Earth's sensitivity to CO2. The question of how sensitive Earth's climate will be to CO2 emissions remains open.

Prosecutors argue that Harris left his son in the car for seven hours because he was pursuing extramarital affairs. Defense attorneys admit Harris's philandering but argue that his son's death was a tragic accident. The fate of Harris is now in the hands of the jurors. The trial has gained significant publicity, leading to the proceedings being moved 300 miles away. Harris faces charges of malice murder, felony murder, and cruelty to children. The prosecution emphasized Harris's illicit chats with women, including underage girls, on the day of his son's death. The defense argues that Harris's sexual behavior is unrelated to the death. The prosecution highlighted the position of the car seat as evidence that Harris could see his son. The defense claims that the investigation was biased and misled the jurors.

This year, a record number of people have drowned in the Mediterranean while attempting to escape war and seek a better life. Over 3,800 people have died, averaging about 90 deaths per week. The largest migration of refugees since World War II is currently taking place, with over 65 million people displaced from their homes. Despite fewer people crossing this year compared to 2015, the death toll has increased. The main routes across the Mediterranean are from Turkey to Greece, Libya to Italy, and West Africa to Spain. Syria produces the most refugees, with nearly five million fleeing the country due to civil war. The war in Syria has also resulted in an estimated 430,000 deaths. While some refugees are resettled in countries like the United States and Canada, the majority seek asylum in Europe or remain in the Middle East. With no end to the war in sight, the refugee crisis and the loss of lives will continue.

Lead is bad for you. You don't know what can happen to you later on. I don't like that. Look at those poor kids in Flint. They are suffering really badly and don't deserve it. So keep the fountains off just in case. Better safe then sorry.	Chicago has shut down hundreds of public drinking fountains due to excessive levels of lead in the water. The ongoing crisis in Flint, Michigan has prompted other communities to test for lead, including the Chicago Park District. Testing revealed that nearly a quarter of outdoor fountains and 14 indoor fountains and sinks exceeded the federal standard for lead levels. Some fountains had lead levels 80 times higher than the permissible level. All fountains and sinks with high lead levels have been disabled and will undergo further testing and repairs. The lack of adequate testing for lead in public settings is a national problem, according to public health officials. Lead can have serious health effects, especially in young children, and there is no safe level of lead in the body. Lead pipes and fixtures are still common in communities across the country. While taking a sip from a single fountain may not seriously affect health, it can contribute to cumulative lead exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations like the homeless and children.

The expulsion is seen as an appeasement to Erdogan's demand to close schools linked to exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan accuses of orchestrating a coup attempt. Turkey has arrested tens of thousands of people suspected of ties to Gulen since the coup, and Erdogan has pressured other countries to aid in the crackdown. Pakistan is one of the few countries to comply. The affected schools deny any affiliation with political organizations and are petitioning against the expulsions.

"Sally Brampton, the founding editor of Elle magazine in the UK, took her own life after health professionals failed to offer her help, according to an inquest. Brampton, who had a long battle with depression, drowned after walking into the sea near her home. She had sought help from a psychiatrist and GP but did not receive the assistance she needed. Two months prior to her death, she had been referred to mental health services but was not offered any help. The inquest revealed that crucial information about her condition had not been provided to the relevant services. The coroner concluded that there were missed opportunities to help Brampton, but it is uncertain if they would have changed the outcome. The mental health services have since made changes and no longer use faxes. Brampton was a respected journalist and author, known for her book ""Shoot the Damn Dog"" about her battle with depression."

The bombings killed about 100 people and knocked out running water for two million people. Efforts at the United Nations to revive a cease-fire collapsed, and hopes for humanitarian relief faded. The bombings left residents buried in debris and turned neighborhoods into rubble.

The percentage of murders by guns increased by a whooping 71.5% and net increase in murder erased the gains of the past few years.	According to FBI data, murders in the US increased by 10.8% in 2015, the largest single-year percentage jump since 1971. The rise in violence was driven by an increase in the murders of black men and an increase in gun murders. The number of firearm murders increased by roughly 1,500, while knife murders dropped slightly. The percentage of murders committed with guns increased to 71.5%. Despite the increase in murders, overall crime rates did not increase substantially. The attorney general mentioned the overall increase in violent crime but did not mention the increase in murders. A third of the murder increase was driven by ten larger cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Black men and women face less violence today than in the early 1990s. In a separate incident, two New Jersey Transit buses crashed in the Lincoln Tunnel, injuring as many as 44 people.

Possible increase on prescribed pain killers show reail sales  of the drug increased by four times.	A recent study has found that rates of toddlers and preschoolers being hospitalized for opioid overdoses have more than doubled in recent years. The study analyzed data from over 13,000 records of children admitted to U.S. hospitals between 1997 and 2012. The increase in overdoses is possibly due to the rise in prescribed painkillers, such as OxyContin and Vicodin. Young children are often exposed to these drugs by finding pills on the floor, getting into their parents' purses, or opening bottles. The study emphasizes the need for parents to limit children's exposure to these medications and for companies to improve packaging. The study also highlights the underreported issue of young overdoses in the pediatrics community. Additionally, the study found that heroin poisonings among children increased by 161%.

Bishop Marchel, a leader in the Moldovan Orthodox Church, also attacked Sandu, claiming that her attitude towards Christian morality diverges from normal principles. Sandu defended herself, stating that being a single woman is not a shame. Voronin also criticized Sandu's opponent, Igor Dodon, but implied that Dodon is a preferable choice.

I am a 36-year-old female of the White race. I completed a high school diploma and earn 65000 USD. I had just read an article about treatment of prisoners in Lewisburg.  First off let me say I do believe that people should still be treated with some dignity regardless of their crimes.  I don't believe that prison should be fun, but they should still be treated with some compassion.  An inmate at Lewisburg was set to have a new inmate in his cell who was known to be incredibly violent.  His reputation was widely known.  He had assaulted many and was a pretty scary guy known as the Prophet.  He even assaulted a corrections officer.  The inmate he was set to room with refused to have him and was punished by being shackled in a painful manner.  He was not able to use the bathroom or even breathe all that well.  He stayed like this for 28 days.  The prison denies the claims.	Inmates at Lewisburg federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania are forced to live with violent cellmates or be placed in restraints. Inmates have no say in who they share a cell with, even if the cellmate has a violent history or severe mental illness. If they refuse a cellmate, they are placed in restraints for hours or days. Restraints are also used as punishment for inmates who break rules or get into fights. The conditions in the Special Management Unit (SMU) at Lewisburg are harsh, with inmates spending nearly 24 hours a day in small cells with little room to move. In 2014 and 2015, there were 228 in-cell fights and assaults at Lewisburg, resulting in injuries and even deaths. The use of restraints at Lewisburg has been criticized by inmates, lawyers, and auditors, but the Bureau of Prisons denies any mistreatment. Changes have been made to the SMU, but the use of restraints remains unchanged. Inmates are left with few options: accept a violent cellmate or be restrained.

The Obama administration has announced that it will resume deportations of undocumented Haitian immigrants due to a surge in Haitian migrants seeking to enter the United States. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, deportations were suspended, but they were partially resumed later on for those convicted of serious crimes or considered a threat to national security. However, since last spring, thousands of Haitian migrants who had moved to Brazil for work have been making their way to the United States. These migrants have been allowed to enter the country and given permission to stay for up to three years under a humanitarian parole provision. With the full resumption of deportations, Haitians without visas will now be put into expedited removal proceedings. The surge in Haitian migrants has overwhelmed shelters in Tijuana, and many migrants have chosen to sleep on the streets. The change in American policy has surprised advocates in San Diego and Tijuana, who object to the policy change that does not reflect any actual change in reality.

The Forced From Home exhibit organized by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) aims to teach empathy for refugees by allowing participants to experience the journey of a displaced person. The exhibit has been attended by over 17,000 people, including 3,400 students. MSF hopes to communicate the reality of the refugee crisis and generate empathy in a time when anti-refugee sentiment is on the rise. The exhibit creates an empathetic response by assigning each participant a specific displaced person's identity and sharing personal stories from aid-workers who have served in MSF camps. The exhibit challenges the notion that empathy is a globalized response, as humans are wired to empathize with those in their immediate surroundings. However, empathy can be strengthened with practice and training programs have shown promise in changing people's responses to others' suffering. While empathy alone is not a solution to the refugee crisis, it is a necessary component in finding a genuine solution.

Treatment was poor and it was so common for children to die that cemeteries were often built on the ground. The last school didn't even close until the 90's! How awful.	For nearly a century, the Canadian government forcibly assimilated indigenous Canadians by taking them from their families and placing them in church-run boarding schools. These schools punished students for speaking their native languages or observing indigenous traditions, and subjected them to physical and sexual assault, medical experimentation, and sterilization. Photographer Daniella Zalcman's book, Signs of Your Identity, documents the lasting effects of this trauma through double exposure portraits of former students and related places or items. The system caused the death of at least 6,000 children, and the last Indian Residential School closed in 1996. The government issued its first apology in 2008.

New research suggests that habitat degradation poses a greater risk to the survival of turtles and tortoises than rising global temperatures. Over 60% of these species are listed as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered due to factors such as trading, collection for food and medicine, and habitat degradation. The study used climate models and the fossil record to investigate the impact of long-term climate change on these species. Results show that turtles and tortoises were able to withstand warmer climates in the past as long as there was enough water to support them. However, they are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, making climate change a significant threat to their conservation status.

Republicans in Congress are concerned about potential losses in the upcoming election. They are accepting the possibility of a Hillary Clinton victory and a Democratic majority in the Senate. This has led to discussions about how Republicans should proceed after the election. They must decide whether to cooperate with Democrats and try to get things done, or to adopt a noncooperative strategy in hopes of regaining control in the 2018 midterm elections. There are also questions about the future of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the Supreme Court nominee. Republicans fear that Clinton will be influenced by progressive forces and that compromises will be difficult to achieve. They also worry about the dissatisfaction among their voters and the potential backlash if they work with Democrats. However, some Republicans argue that waiting until 2018 may be a better strategy. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer believes there is a moral imperative to get government working again and hopes to work with Republicans. Hillary Clinton is seen as someone capable of building relationships with Republican leaders. Overall, if Democrats win the White House and Senate, considerable effort will be needed to bring a new spirit to a gridlocked Congress.

The unrest, which began last year, has led to attacks on industrial farms and factories, particularly those with state ties or owned by foreigners. Ethiopia's industrialization program and economic growth are at risk as current investors reconsider their options and new ones shy away. The government declared a state of emergency in response to the violence, leading to concerns from international organizations. The government has promised to help investors recoup their losses, but the future remains uncertain. Many investors are waiting to see if the government can address the underlying issues causing the unrest.

Germany, which took in more asylum seekers than the rest of Europe combined, is facing the challenge of deciding who gets to stay. Syrians and Iraqis are almost guaranteed sanctuary, while Nigerians and Pakistanis are more likely to have their claims rejected. Even Syrians are increasingly falling short of winning full refugee status. Critics argue that asylum officials are turning a deaf ear to genuine petitions from asylum seekers arriving from countries outside the Middle East war zones. The German government is increasingly targeting migrants deemed ineligible for protection and is enforcing deportation more strictly. The system is flawed, with many appeals against the Federal Office's decisions and concerns about inexperienced decision-makers and declining interpreter quality.

"In his first televised sit-down interview since becoming President-elect, Donald Trump told his supporters to stop harassing minorities. He expressed sadness over reports of harassment and urged his supporters to ""stop it."" Trump also criticized the protests that have broken out since his election, calling them ""horrible"" and blaming the press for exaggerating the incidents. He discussed his plans for FBI Director James Comey, saying he hasn't made up his mind about whether to ask for his resignation. Trump also addressed his stance on same-sex marriage, abortion, and deporting undocumented immigrants. He pledged to focus on deporting criminals and building a border wall. Trump defended his transition team, which includes lobbyists, saying that they know the system but will be phased out. He stuck by his claim that he knows more than American generals about fighting ISIS. Trump also expressed support for ditching the Electoral College and handing the presidency to the winner of the popular vote. He dismissed concerns about the impact of his presidency on his family's businesses, saying that saving the country is more important. Trump plans to turn down the presidential salary and does not intend to change his tone."

According to an FBI report, hate crimes against Muslims in the US have increased by 67% in one year, reaching the highest number since 2001. The report also reveals a rise in hate crimes against Jewish, black, and LGBTQ individuals. These figures have been linked to President-elect Donald Trump's anti-minority rhetoric, which has fueled public anger and aggression. Experts believe that the actual number of hate crimes is likely higher than reported, and they expect the situation to worsen due to the mainstreaming of Islamophobia by Trump.

"Multiple studies show that Trump's sexist rhetoric can have a significant impact on thinking, stress, and self-esteem. Women have expressed feeling gross and objectified by his comments, and even trauma victims have been distressed by his behavior. Trump's defense that his words are ""just words"" or ""locker room talk"" does not render them harmless, as rude language can impair cognition and lead to less creative thinking. Uncivil political discourse, especially in a presidential debate, undermines trust in government and discourages women from running for office. Discriminatory speech has negative consequences for women, leading to anger, depression, and lower self-esteem. Different types of discrimination can compound each other, with women of color experiencing even greater harm. Trump's candidacy exposes the bleak state of gender relations in the US and raises questions about how sexism will be taken seriously in the future."

This article discussed pollution from both cows and cars. I feel worried after reading it because so many sources of pollution exist today and there dont seem to be many good solutions to begin repairing the earth. Farming produces methane gases, and cars create pollution from carbon. Both are essential to our lives.	Cows release methane gas, a greenhouse gas, which has a much higher negative effect on the climate compared to carbon dioxide. The livestock industry, including cattle breeding and farming, is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector. Livestock pastures and feed production use a significant portion of the Earth's land surface, leading to deforestation and habitat loss. The increasing demand for meat and dairy products contributes to the overgrowth of the farming industry and its impact on global warming. Producing one kilogram of beef emits an equivalent amount of CO2 as an average European car every 250 kilometers and consumes a significant amount of energy. Consuming less meat and dairy products is an effective way to reduce one's carbon footprint and protect the environment.

Problems this big take a lot of empathy, and strong leadership. It's hard to find one person with those qualities.	The debate in South Africa revolves around whether bike lanes are racist and classist. The lack of bike lanes in Johannesburg has led to dangerous conditions for cyclists, with many fatalities. The new mayor, Herman Mashaba, halted the construction of new bike lanes due to the cost and prioritization of basic services for the poor. Opponents argue that bike lanes symbolize a city that is not designed for everyone, while proponents see them as a way to address historical inequalities and create a more livable city. However, the implementation of bike lanes has been problematic, with misuse by taxis and cars parking in them. The issue became a political target, with bike lanes being criticized as a symbol of decadence and out-of-touch thinking. Despite the controversy, some cyclists, like Dan Khumalo, appreciate the presence of bike lanes as it makes their commutes safer.

It seems like that should just stop. Keep what banana trees you can, and plant other things that aren't so fragile. We shouldn't use toxic chemicals.	The Cavendish banana, which is the most widely sold banana in the Western world, is facing the threat of extinction due to its vulnerability to diseases. The previous popular variety, Gros Michel, was wiped out by a fungal disease called Fusarium wilt. The Cavendish replaced it but is now susceptible to a disease called Black Sigatoka. Additionally, a new strain of Fusarium wilt called Tropical Race 4 (TR4) is spreading and could devastate the banana industry. To combat these diseases, scientists are studying the genetics of wild banana varieties and banana pathogens to find resistant genes. However, there has been little effort and funding for this research. By increasing genetic diversity in cultivated bananas, the industry can reduce its vulnerability to diseases. Scientists have already identified the genome sequences of bananas and the fungi causing the diseases, which provides a basis for identifying disease-resistant genes. With the use of genetic engineering and plant breeding, these genes can be transferred into desired cultivars. It is crucial to increase the pool of genetic diversity in cultivated bananas to avoid repeating the history of the Gros Michel and Cavendish varieties.

The E-Rate program, which provides subsidies for schools to enhance internet connections, has received bipartisan support and billions of dollars in funding. However, a study in North Carolina found that the program had no benefits for students and actually hurt their performance. Other research has also shown little to no gains in student achievement with improved computer access. Despite this, the program has continued to receive funding and has been plagued with fraud and lax oversight. Additionally, the push for more advanced networks and expensive technology may not be necessary, as many educational resources do not require high bandwidth connections. The funding for E-Rate comes from a tax on long distance telecommunications, which disproportionately affects lower-income households. The article suggests suspending the program until its effectiveness can be objectively tested, and exploring other options for using the funds.

The article highlights the side effects of various birth control options for women, which are equally as bad but have not been halted. Women have always borne the burden of birth control, and the article argues that men should share in the responsibility. The availability of birth control has been revolutionary for women, leading to wage gains, increased college enrollment, and a decline in teen pregnancies. The article points out the double standard in the standards for male and female birth control, with women being expected to endure more side effects. The article concludes by highlighting the hypocrisy that women face in exchange for reproductive freedom.

"PTSD is a misunderstood and stigmatized disorder that affects many veterans. It is estimated that 8 million Americans suffer from PTSD, with rates among Vietnam War and Iraq War veterans being particularly high. The negative connotations surrounding PTSD prevent many veterans from seeking help. Veterans want others to know that referring to them as ""weak"" is ignorant, as war experiences are incomprehensible to those who haven't lived through them. PTSD symptoms can be masked and go unnoticed, making it difficult to recognize. Many PTSD sufferers suffer in silence, fearing judgment and trying to appear strong. Contrary to popular belief, PTSD does not make individuals violent. Recovery from PTSD is possible, and veterans encourage others to seek help and know that they are not alone."

His decision to embrace Donald Trump has worsened his chances of winning. His opponent, Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel, has received significant financial support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Issa has tried to fight back by highlighting accusations made against Applegate by his former wife. In another California district, Representative Jeff Denham is also facing a tough re-election fight. Denham, like Issa, has expressed support for Trump. Both districts have a large and growing Latino population, which is expected to vote against Trump. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC have invested over $4 million to defeat Issa and Denham. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, has given over $1.6 million to Denham. Denham's refusal to disavow Trump has put him at odds with the editorial board of The Modesto Bee, the largest newspaper in his district, which has endorsed his opponent, Michael Eggman.

Hate crimes against Muslims in the United States reached their highest level since 2001, with a 67% increase in anti-Islamic incidents in 2015 compared to the previous year. Experts and advocates attribute this rise to anger over terrorist attacks and anti-Islam rhetoric during the presidential campaign. The Council on American-Islamic Relations blames the mainstreaming of Islamophobia by public figures like Donald Trump for the increase in hate crimes. Overall hate crimes increased by 6.7% in 2015, with anti-black, anti-Jewish, and anti-sexual orientation incidents also rising. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported 201 incidents of election-related harassment and intimidation, and there were reports of hateful acts before and after Trump's election. The data is limited as many law enforcement agencies do not report hate crimes voluntarily. Analysts believe that the spike in hate crimes against Muslims is due to anger after terrorist attacks, prejudice against Muslims, and the labeling of Muslims as enemies.

The prevalence of sleep disorders among veterans has increased from less than one percent in 2000 to about six percent in 2010. Sleep apnea is the most common sleep disorder among veterans, followed by insomnia. Veterans with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic diseases also have higher rates of sleep disorders. The study did not establish a direct link between PTSD and sleep disorders, but a follow-up study will examine this connection.

The damage has already been done, and the global average temperature of 2015 will be the norm by 2040. Extreme seasons will become the norm within decades if emissions continue as usual. However, there is still hope to prevent record-breaking heat at a seasonal and regional level with immediate action on carbon emissions. The Paris climate agreement's proposed emissions cuts are not enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. To keep global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius, emissions need to be slashed by an additional 25 percent by 2030. Despite concerns about President-elect Donald Trump's stance on climate change, world leaders and activists remain committed to battling climate change."

""Thinking broadly about which wells are vulnerable hasn't been done before. Based on our modeling, if there is any contamination, it is likely very localized, but over the next few decades"	Overpumping of groundwater in Dhaka, Bangladesh is causing a water crisis that extends beyond the city center. The pumping has caused groundwater levels to drop significantly over the past 50 years, leading to water quality and supply issues in surrounding peri-urban and rural communities. The presence of naturally occurring arsenic in shallow groundwater further exacerbates the problem. The pumping is causing faster groundwater flow, which can transport contaminants like arsenic to deeper areas of the aquifer, even outside the city limits. This poses a threat to deep wells used for arsenic mitigation in these areas. The researchers used detailed subsurface measurements to model the geology of Dhaka and found that strong pumping and heterogeneity in the underground sediments affect the hydrology of the area. Heterogeneity refers to the way sand and clay are oriented underground and is critical to how contaminants move in groundwater. In a delta system like Bangladesh, the clay layers are chopped up, allowing water to move in unpredictable ways and creating uncertainty about well contamination. The researchers theorize that if pumping continues at current levels, some wells outside the city center could become contaminated sooner than expected. The low water levels caused by pumping could also compromise the operation of handpumps in these areas. Arsenic is tasteless, odorless, and colorless, making it difficult for communities to detect its presence in water without testing. The researchers' models showed that typical hydrogeological data used to assess well safety is not predictive in this type of heterogeneous system. This highlights the need for water quality monitoring and the development of artificial groundwater recharge methods to address the water crisis in the region.

At least 55 people have died and dozens are missing after a boat carrying migrants capsized off the coast of Egypt. The boat, which was overcrowded with up to 450 migrants, sank near the city of Rosetta. So far, 163 survivors have been rescued and four suspected human traffickers have been arrested. The search for more survivors will focus on the boat's cold storage room, where witnesses say around 100 people were trapped. This incident highlights the dangerous journey that migrants are taking to reach Europe, with Egypt becoming an increasingly popular departure point.

Supposedly there are measures which could prevent much of the problems through immunization, but we both know how receptive the world is to medicine these days.	The future of the Zika virus is uncertain. Experts have different opinions on how long it will stick around and how often it will return. Some believe it will behave like other arboviruses, recurring regularly with upticks in cases during the rainy season. Others predict that it will vanish in a few years, similar to chikungunya. The current outbreak in the Americas is due to the fact that people in the region had no immunity to the virus. Future outbreaks may be smaller if people develop immunity, but there could also be long lulls between outbreaks, allowing for a buildup of younger people who aren't immune. It is unclear if there will be fewer cases of microcephaly in the future due to the immunity gained from Zika infections. The impact of mosquito control efforts on young girls getting infected is also uncertain. It is unknown if Zika will strike Africa and Asia with the same ferocity as the Americas, but experts believe the two strains of Zika will be cross-protective. The uncertainty surrounding Zika's future affects the prospects for a vaccine. If Zika activity subsides, it will be difficult to conduct clinical trials to prove the vaccine's effectiveness. However, the fear of the virus's impact on developing fetuses may continue to drive demand for a vaccine.

"The Trump campaign has been pursuing a strategy of publicly courting black voters while privately seeking to depress their turnout, according to a BusinessWeek article. The campaign has three major voter suppression operations targeting idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. These operations include placing negative ads on select African American radio stations and using Facebook ""dark posts"" to deliver targeted messages. The campaign believes that depressing Clinton's vote total among these groups will benefit Trump. However, there is evidence that negative campaigning does not significantly depress voter turnout. Trump's approach to African Americans has been seen as insincere, with many of his events aimed at them taking place in predominantly white areas. As a result, Trump's polling among African Americans is poor, with him trailing Clinton by a large margin. While Trump's advisors believe that he doesn't need black votes to win, future Republican candidates will, and the campaign's efforts to suppress black voter turnout may harm the party's relationship with this demographic for years to come."
